# Nylilsa's GitHub page

Website link: https://nylilsa.github.io

On this website, you will find all documented bugs and glitches of Touhou Project I have been able to find ! This is mainly a solo project of mine, from developing this website, discovering glitches, verifying glitches others have found, doing all the writing, etc., so excuse me if there are any inaccuracies !

Additionally, there are a few guides written on various topics that may not necessarily be related to one another which can be found over on the Guides section in the sidebar (though, that is its secondary purpose).
