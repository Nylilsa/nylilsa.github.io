[hr_major] 

The TRS Challenges™️ is a list of various bingo-style challenges a bunch of very experienced and skilled players put together. The challenges are divided into different difficulties, with the most difficult ones being made for the best of the best ! Of course, I wanted to see how many challenges I could do myself, so [jumpto=#/about_me/trs_challenges#mycompletions]below[/jumpto] you'll find a full table of my progress !

For the list of challenges, you can find them [a=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1082774272579227658/1082775634511675442/TRS_Challenges_1.png]here[/a].
