# Nylilsa's Challenges
[hr_major] 

This page consists a large list of my own homemade Touhou challenges ! These tasks are designed to be short and sweet. You can except most challenges to be related to performing glitches, but sometimes I'll toss in survival, scoring or speedrun tasks. I designed the tasks to be based around performing tricks that would usually not be used in survival/scoring, so except to learn some new things ! The challenges are only [hl2]sorted by game[/hl2] and they are [hl2]not sorted by difficulty[/hl2].

For most challenges the use of [a=https://github.com/touhouworldcup/thprac/releases]thprac[/a] is needed. In some cases, I will explicitly state that the use of thprac or any other tool is prohibited.
