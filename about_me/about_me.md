[hr_major]  

Hello there and welcome to this little corner of the internet of mine !

The name is Nylilsa. I'm your average Dutch sleep-deprived college student. (´｡• ᵕ •｡`)

I like making stuff, which explains why this website exists. I quite like random stuff that aren't really related to each other, such as photography, literature, linguistics and programming (programming to a degree because I'm still new to it. lol).

On top of this, I like playing games and exploring its limits. More specifically, I enjoy glitch hunting as it is just super interesting to see how badly you can break games. On top of this, I love the thought of TASing Touhou one day as TASes are very satisfying to watch (major thanks to pannenkoek2012 and Plush). I've lurked around in several communities before (few decent, most atrocious) but I do feel welcome here.

All Touhou games are quite fun, but in particular I enjoy the ones that have the most interesting mechanics in them. Especially games that can be speedrun that does not only use bombs on bosses are the ones that are the most fun to play for me.
There's a few games that I do love to score as well, which is usually in games where the runs are done quickly.

Also, I'm not too good of a player so don't expect too much. I want to enjoy the things I do !


## About this Website
[hr_minor]

On this website, you will find all documented glitches I have been able to find. Additionally, there are a few guides written on various topics that are not necessarily related to one another.

[purpose of website]
### Guides

Sometimes I will write guides. They will all be posted here on this website.

### Patches

If I ever make patches, a list of patches will be compiled on this website.

### Bugs/Glitch

If you want to find out how *I* glitch hunt, I suggest you check out [this guide (HYPERLINK)] I wrote.

Disclaimer: In the context of this website, I define the words "glitch" and "bug" to be synonymous. I define the word "glitch" to be as follows:
[box=600]GLITCH <br>
An event that can be done without the use of third-party tools which the developers did not intend for.[/box]

Examples:
+ Writing a macro that presses X every time the player is hit that makes the player invincible is a glitch.
+ Setting your score to -100 through a memory viewer is not a glitch.
+ Doing an action that can only be done by modifying a game is not a glitch.
+ Clipping out of bounds by TASing the game is a glitch.
+ Clipping out of bounds by first setting the player in a state that is not achievable without a memory viewer is not a glitch. 

Of course, the term "glitch" is arbitrarily chosen in the context of this website, which leaves a lot of room for argumentation of what can and what cannot be considered to be a glitch.



Every game has its glitches and bugs
