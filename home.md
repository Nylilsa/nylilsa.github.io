Hello there, I hope you are having a wonderful day today ! On website I want to provide game knowledge and resources to the Touhou community ! This is a solo project of mine, meaning I did all the coding, research, design, more research, doing all the writing, etc., so excuse me if there are any inaccuracies !

## About this Website
[hr_minor]

### World Record Progression

There is a page titled [jumpto=#/wr]World Record Progression[/jumpto]. The page is a [hl2]comprehensive Touhou world records tracker[/hl2], updated every so often. The page includes an interactive graph and a table of your selected game along with [hl2]replay support[/hl2] for most WR entries ! Please feel free to check it out as this is the cumulation of about a year's worth of hard work from replay gathering, replay processing, file management, score gathering, etc. !

### Bugs/Glitch

This website's primary purpose was to be a [hl2]repository for all documented glitches[/hl2] I have been able to find and properly document of Touhou Project. This part is still Work In Progress: if you want to know more about a game's glitches it is best to [jumpto=#/home#contact]contact me personally[/jumpto].

### Guides

Sometimes I or other people will write [hl2]guides[/hl2]. Those guides are posted on this website. If you wish for a Touhou-related guide of yours to be posted on this website, please [jumpto=#/home#contact]contact me[/jumpto] and we can talk about it.
