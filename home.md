Hello there ! I hope you are having a wonderful day today ! On website I want to provide game knowledge and resources to the Touhou community ! This is a solo project of mine, meaning I did all the coding, research, design, more research, doing all the writing, etc., so excuse me if there are any inaccuracies !

Additionally, there are a few guides written on various topics that may not necessarily be related to one another which can be found over on the Guides section in the sidebar.

Currently, there are three main things on this site:
1. Descriptions and explanations of Touhou glitches
2. A WR progression page that covers all categories of almost all games
3. Some guides that people have written

All of the content can be found in the <button onclick="toggleSidebar()" class='url'>sidebar</button> !
