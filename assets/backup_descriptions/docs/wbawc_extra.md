<h2>Wily Beast and Weakest Creature Extra Speedrunning</h2>


Overview \
The optimal shottype to use is Youmu Otter. Youmu Otter has got the best DPS out of all characters and her bomb is perfect against Saki’s non-spells. The hypers Youmu must get are all either Wolf or Eagle hypers since they are the strongest. Eagle is used against attacks that can be shotgunned and Wolf is used on patterns that are impossible to shotgun RTA. 

Kutaka mid-boss can be bombed on her spells, so a bomb on all three spell-cards are used. Since Saki is an Extra boss, it is impossible to bomb her spells. However, it is possible to activate her hitbox on the spell-card “Oni-Shaped Hoi Polloi” by bombing either before or during the card. This allows the spell-card to be speedkilled with ease.

In-depth mechanics

Youmu Wolf, Youmu Otter or Youmu Eagle?

Youmu Eagle is infamously known for her lower damage cap. Both Youmu Wolf and Youmu Otter can deal up to 160 damage per frame while Youmu Eagle can only deal a maximum of 60 damage per frame. This is noticeable when Youmu Eagle uses her focused shot on bosses: Its damage output is still moderate, but it is significantly lower than Youmu Wolf and Youmu Otter. This severely limits the capabilities of Youmu Eagle doing well, thus it is not recommended to use the Eagle variant.

Youmu Otter’s bombs are a lot more intensive compared to the bombs of Youmu Wolf. Youmu Otter bombs last for a much longer time and the bomb itself rapidly disintegrates whatever is on-screen. The duration and the damage output make Youmu Otter a much more attractive shottype for speedrunning.

The following assumes that all Youmus have 4.00 power.

One noticeable difference between the two shottypes are their focussed shots. Youmu Otter has in total six slashes but Youmu Wolf has two additional slashes on top of what Youmu Otter has. Both Youmu’s first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth slashes deal the exact same damage.

One important thing worth mentioning is the fact that Youmu Otter's shot theoretically deals more damage than Youmu Wolf's shot. The slashes of Youmu Wolf and Youmu Otter deal the exact same amount of damage and on top of that Youmu Wolf has two additional slashes. However, how long the slashes are on-screen is also important. Youmu Wolf deals less damage than Youmu Otter because Youmu Wolf's slashes quickly slash through Saki. This means that the amount of frames one of her slashes hits the boss is lower than the duration of Youmu Otter's slashes.

Youmu’s Wolf Hyper

Not to be confused with Youmu Wolf’s Hyper, which wouldn’t make much sense.

Youmu’s Wolf Hyper can be activated by picking up three or more Wolf tokens. This makes Youmu constantly shoot many slashes with a very small delay between every wave of slashes. It is like Youmu Wolf’s slashes but without the unfocused shot and without the charging. Theoretically, Youmu’s Wolf Hyper has the best DPS output. However, in practice only a fraction of Youmu’s Wolf Hyper’s slashes hit the boss, thus most of the time Youmu cannot deal the maximum damage.

Something interesting happens when Youmu breaks her hyper. The fact that she 

Youmu’s Eagle Hyper

Not to be confused with Youmu Eagle’s Hyper, which wouldn’t make much sense.

Youmu’s Eagle Hyper can be activated by picking up three or more Eagle tokens. This makes Youmu shoot a very widespread attack. It is weak on bosses from afar but it is extremely powerful when used up close. In fact, it is even more powerful than Youmu’s Wolf hyper and it’s also more powerful than Youmu Wolf/Youmu Otter without hypers.

The same thing with Youmu’s Wolf Hyper is that slashes spawn when the hyper is broken. The sum of those slashes deals more damage than the Eagle Hyper themselves thus it is worth to abuse this mechanic when an attack is about to die. 

Another odd thing about Youmu’s Eagle Hyper is that more than one Hyper wave can spawn. Hyper wave in this context is defined as Youmu’s Eagle Hyper. This phenomenon can be reproduced if any Youmu shot is fully charged/releasing her slashes. This only lasts for  exactly the same as Youmu’s slashes last for, which is about half a second. An example of which can be found here: [https://youtu.be/CpbhETTrhys](https://youtu.be/CpbhETTrhys) 

Resource route

Otter starts with four bombs in stock and it resets to four bombs after every death. The bombs are used on all three of Kutaka’s spells, all eight of Saki’s non-spells and it is also used after Saki’s eighth spell “Follow me, Unafraid” and right before her tenth spell “Deeds of Devilish Beasts”. One death is required, which is done after Kutaka’s mid-boss and before Saki appears. In total, **thirteen bombs** are used in this extra at minimum. One can of course decide to use their last bomb before the suicide, but it is not required. Seven out of thirteen bombs are from Youmu Otter herself, so the other six come from bomb tokens. As it turns out there are exactly eighteen bomb tokens in this Extra, enough to gain six bombs. 

Lives are really not that important so feel free to miss any life pieces. \
 \
Entering Kutaka and Saki, you want to have a decent amount of tokens on-screen, increasing your chances of getting the right hyper when needed. Throughout the fight, try to preserve as many tokens as possible. If a token is coloured dark try to prioritise that token before it says farewell.

Optimal Bomb & Hyper route

For some clarification as to what is meant by what is written below:

Bomb = Bomb, pressing X to bomb;

Wolf = Wolf token;

Eagle = Eagle token;

Life  Frag= Life piece/Life fragment token;

Bomb Frag = Bomb piece/Bomb fragment token;

Special = Three chickens/Special token;

Other = Any token;

Break =  Interval between two attacks.

My personal best and average time is given in brackets behind the name of the attack.

[PB, average]

Pre mid-boss

No Hypers

Kutaka [1:17.00, 1:17.00]

**“Watershed of Blood” [4.17s, 4.50s]**

No Hypers, 1 Bomb

The reason why no bomb is used before the spell is because it is impossible to since there is dialogue before the spell starts. The reason why no hyper is used is because using a hyper would kill the spell too fast. In fact, Youmu can kill the spell-card in around 4.15s without hypers. The reason why it mustn’t be killed in less than 4.15s is so that a bomb can be used before her second spell “Hell Realm Sight-Line” starts.

**Break**

Bomb

Bomb as soon as possible. If the speedkill on her first spell “Watershed of Blood” goes well, it means Youmu has about less than half a second to bomb before Kutaka’s second spell-card “Hell Realm Sight-Line” is declared.

**“Hell Realm Sight-Line” [3.20s, 3.50s]**

3 Eagle, 1 Life, 1 Other

One of the tokens is a Life piece token since it is extremely easy to accidentally pick up three or more bomb piece tokens throughout Kutaka’s mid-boss, which you would want to avoid. The suicide after her 

**Break**

**“Highly Spirited Oniwatari” [3.20s, 3.50s]**

3 Eagle, 2 Other

There are two variations of the route: One is to do an intentional hyper break to speedkill the attack and one is to capture the card. Not capturing the card means there is no special token. However, this method does save a few frames.

Post mid-boss [1:34.20, 1:36.00]

If the previous spell “Highly Spirited Oniwatari” is captured, then it is advised to get a hyper with one special token and four bomb pieces. Before the hyper, you must die in order to reset your bombs. The reason why the bomb pieces are picked up is because there is a chance a bomb token will fly off-screen during Saki’s fight, which would force you to a suicide at one point during the fight.

Saki [2:48.20 2:50.00]

**Non-spell 1**

1 Bomb.

**“Thrilling Shot” [7.08s, 9.00s]**

3 Wolf, 2 Other.

**Non-spell 2 **

1 Bomb.

**“Lightning Neigh” [7.50s, 9.00s]**

4 Wolf, 1 Other.

**Non-spell 3**

1 Bomb.

**“Dense Crowd” [7.30s, 8.00s]**

3 Eagle, 2 Other.

**Non-spell 4**

1 Bomb.

**“Beast Epidemicity” [6.90s, 8.00s]**

3 Eagle, 2 Other.

**Non-spell 5**

1 Bomb.

**”Triangle Chase” [6.53s, 7.40s]**

No Hypers OR Neutral Hyper.

[https://youtu.be/WSH4oEW0K80?t=241](https://youtu.be/WSH4oEW0K80?t=241) 

**Non-spell 6**

1 Bomb.

**“Black Pegasus Meteor Shot” [7.90s, 9.00s]**

4 Wolf, 1 Other.

**Non-spell 7**

1 Bomb.

**“Muscle Explosion” [9.00s, 10.30s]**

3 Wolf, 2 Other.

**Non-spell 8**

1 Bomb.

**“Follow Me, Unafraid” [12.00s, 14.50s]**

5 Wolf.

**Break**

1 Bomb.

**“Oni-Shaped Hoi Polloi” [9.10s, 10.00s]**

3 Eagle, 2 Other.

**Break**

Wait for 2.5 seconds, then 1 Bomb.

**”Deeds of Devilish Beasts” [28.20s, 30.50s]**

3 Eagle, 2 Other. AND 3 Wolf, 2 Other.

The final hyper guarantees you a free hit and also a more stress-free final, but it is extremely hard to get this hyper. I have only managed to get this once before, which was on the 28.20s capture.
