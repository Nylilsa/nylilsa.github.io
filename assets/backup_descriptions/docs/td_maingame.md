<h2>Ten Desires Main Game Speedrunning</h2>


<h2>Overview</h2>


The best shottype for speedrunning is Marisa. Not only her trance is very powerful, but also her bomb. In addition, her trance allows her to become a lot quicker meaning it is easier to hop from one side to the other. Trancing is done on both bosses and stages while bombing is strictly restricted to bosses only. The resources in TD are sparse meaning that the route will not work if you do not have the perfect number of resources. Every life and nearly every bomb you get is used. It’s a strict game to speedrun but very joyful once you get the hang of it.

<h2>Marisa vs Youmu</h2>


Marisa and Youmu are both incredibly powerful shottypes in Ten Desires. Marisa has her powerful missiles and Youmu cuts through everything like how a hot knife cuts through butter. 

When comparing both the damage output of the trances, it turns out that Youmu’s damage is roughly equivalent to Marisa’s. Though, the results are so identical [time difference is +/- 0.10s] that one can say both trances are equally effective. 

Though, when comparing the bombs we quickly notice that Youmu lacks the damage to speedkill patterns. Theoretically, if all the slashes of her bomb were to hit the boss then the bomb damage would roughly be equal, but that severely depends on luck.

Youmu also has an issue with her trance, it being the reach. On certain sections you would like to stall the spirits so you can quickly refill the gauge after the trance, but Youmu picks up the spirits when killing the enemies. One way to prevent this is by sitting far to the left or right of the enemies, but this is impossible on some sections due to the way enemies enter the screen (think about stage 5’s yin yangs). 

On a few occasions this tactic is also used on bosses. The issue that comes with it is that you will not generate enough spirits since Youmu will be too far away from the boss. 

<h2>Mechanics</h2>


<h3>Bombing</h3>


Bombing is done by pressing X if the player has at least one bomb in its inventory. This unleashes a powerful attack that deals a ludicrous amount of damage.

<h3>Trancing</h3>


Trancing is a mechanic that makes the player invincible for a short duration whilst also buffing the player’s shottype. Trancing also changes how many resources you get from spirits. More detail can be found in the next section.  \
 \
Trancing done in various ways. There is a gauge at the bottom left that goes up to 3 spirits. Once filled, you cannot gain more.

 \
The most common way to trance is to completely fill up the gauge and then press C. The duration of the trance will be 10 seconds. Once the trance is over, you go back to your normal state and your gauge is reset to 0.  As a bonus, you're given some invincibility frames.

However, one exception of this is if trancing is done right before a boss dialogue. The trance will stop once the dialogue starts and you will retain a part of your gauge.

Additionally, you can death-trance, which acts like a deathbomb but for trancing instead.

Trancing can also be done if at least one out of three spirits of your gauge is filled, but this requires the player to die. The duration is proportional to how filled the gauge is. Once the trance is over, you die and drop 31 grey spirits.

<h3>Gaining spirits</h3>


There are four types of spirits: blue, grey, pink and green. Once a spirit is on-screen it takes 10 seconds for it to despawn.

Under normal circumstances,



* Blue spirits give the player +10 PIV;
* Grey spirits give the player score that is equal to the current PIV;
* Pink spirits give the player +1 life fragment;
* Green spirits give the player +1 bomb fragment.

Collecting the spirits while trancing gives a different result.



* Blue spirits give the player +100 PIV;
* Grey spirits give the player score that is equal to the current PIV (no difference);
* Pink spirits give the player +2 life fragments;
* Green spirits give the player +2 bomb fragments.*

There is a feature where trancing green spirits does not always give you +2 bomb fragments. This happens if the player has ⅞ bomb fragments in its stock. Trancing the green spirit will not give you 1 ⅛ bomb fragments, but instead that bomb fragment will only count as one, meaning you will be left with 1 bomb instead.

This phenomenon however, does not happen with extends.

<h4>Speedkilling</h4>


Speedkilling involves killing the enemy quickly enough resulting in their drop being blue spirit items.

<h4>Chaining</h4>


Chaining is the act of continuously uninterruptedly killing enemies. If done enough times, the enemies will drop additional grey spirits. The chaining stops if no enemies have been killed for a very short duration (approximately 0.75 seconds).

<h4>Shotgunning</h4>


On bosses, the number of spirits you get depends on your damage output and the distance between the boss and you. If you shoot the boss, the boss generates blue spirit items. If you shotgun the boss for a moment, the boss will eventually generate grey items too.

Marisa has the ability to deal more damage when shotgunning, hence you want to be so close to the boss.

<h2>Differences between Difficulties</h2>


There are a few notable differences across the difficulties.

Easy: Yuyuko’s 4th spell-card does **not** exist. Seiga’s mid-spell does **not** exist either. Final section of stage 5 has **6** fairies.

Normal: Yuyuko’s 4th spell-card does **not** exist. Seiga’s mid-spell does exist. Final section of stage 5 has **7** fairies.

Hard: Yuyuko’s 4th spell-card does exist. Seiga’s mid-spell does exist. Final section of stage 5 has **7** fairies.

Lunatic: Yuyuko’s 4th spell-card does exist. Seiga’s mid-spell does exist. Final section of stage 5 has **7** fairies.

All three differences affect how fast your run is.



1. Yuyuko’s 4th spell-card adds about 12s to the run.
2. Seiga’s mid-spell does not add any time to the run. However, according to the game’s code the post-midboss stage section is triggered 10 frames after Seiga spawns on Easy mode. On other difficulties where the mid-spell does exist, the post-midboss section starts 730 frames after Seiga’s entry. This means the stage 4 section is 12 seconds shorter on Easy mode by default.*
3. The final part of stage 5 features either 6 or 7 fairies. The stage section ends once there are no more enemies left. Since there is an additional enemy on Normal/Hard/Lunatic, it takes about half a second extra to kill it.

<h2>Resource Route</h2>


This part documents how many resources you need entering/leaving the stages/bosses. In order to refer to bomb fragments, I will use fractions. 2 1/8 bombs means that I have 2 bombs and 1 out of 8 fragments.

If you follow the route well enough you should be able to get enough extends. Since there’s some leniency with lives I will stop mentioning it after Yuyuko. There is also some leniency with bombs, on stages 3-5 so this part of the document will be relatively short.

**Entering Yuyuko**, you want to have 2 1/8 lives and  2 1/8 bombs

**Exiting Yuyuko**, you want to have at least 2 5/8 lives and at least 2 6/8 bombs.

**Entering Kyouko**, before picking up the bomb spirits on-screen, you want to have at least 3 6/8 bombs.

**Exiting Kyouko**, you must be below 1 bomb.

For **Yoshika**, make sure to enter with at least 4 bombs

For **Seiga**, make sure to enter with about 4 bombs. You want to have a bomb entering Stage 5.

For **Futo**, you must have at least 5 4/8 bombs entering. 6 bombs are used on the fight and on three occasions you can gain additional bomb spirits, one of which is tranced.

For **Miko**, you have to enter her with a bomb count between 4 0/8 and 4 4/8 inclusive. No more, no less.

The following applies until the first suicide, which is on the 4th non-spell.

If you enter with 4 4/8 bombs, you must NOT collect ANY bomb spirit during a trance since it will mess up your route. \
If you enter with 4 0/8 bombs, you must collect ALL 2 bomb spirits during a trance.

If you enter with anything between 4 0/8 and 4 4/8, then you are pretty much safe to do the route.

<h2>Stage Route</h2>


This part documents what you have to do on the stage sections. If nothing is mentioned it means you must do those sections normally, meaning you mustn’t die, trance or bomb. Additionally, you must collect some spirit items and power items. 

In order to make things easy you may want to consider playing with music seeing how a lot of my trances depend on it.

**On Stage 1, **you want to focus on power collection.

 

**At the beginning of Stage 2**, you want to suicide in order to refill bombs (you do not if you are playing on Easy mode).

On the second yin-yang section, you want to trance before the resource fairies.

**For the mid-boss** you want to do it normally.

At **the end of Stage 2**, you want to speedkill 3 resource fairies and then kill the 4th fairy once it shoots for the second time. This way no more fairies spawn which saves time.

**At the beginning of Stage 3**, you want to suicide in order to refill bombs.

**For the mid-boss**, you want to time the trance. Shoot down one wave of Kogasa’s mid-non, and wait out the second wave. Once she fires bullets on the third wave, you must shoot her down. Once the bullets of her mid-spell reach you, you must trance and take down the spell. This allows you to get the resources from her mid-non, mid-spell and post-mid-boss resource fairies.

**After the mid-boss** you want to focus on spirit collection.

**At the beginning of Stage 4**, you want to refill your gauge, then, you want to suicide into the middle resource fairy and get enough bomb spirits until the bomb count is 0 6/8 or 0 7/8.  

For the mid-boss, you want to dodge it normally. 

	On Easy mode, you want to trance it as soon as you can


    On any other difficulty, you can either trance it from the beginning and trance its midboss resources straight away leaving you with quite a difficult post-midboss stage section - or you can opt to time down the mid-boss and time the kill.

**Optionally, at the end of Stage 4** you can route an additional trance during the third spam section for safety.

**At the beginning of Stage 5**, you must hug the right side and time a trance in order to kill at least 2 resource fairies. After the first trance, you collect the spirits on-screen and kill the remaining 4 resource fairies WITHOUT picking up the resources.

The second time you trance is at the beginning of the yin-yang sections, which is where you want to collect the resources. Kill the yin yangs for spirits which you can use to refill your gauge.

The third trance is right as the mid-boss spawns, but for it to be effective you must time the kills of the resource fairies so the spirits don’t despawn too early.

**For the mid-boss**, you want to do it normally.

**At the end of Stage 5**, there are two waves of resource fairies. On wave 1, 6 resource fairies. Two seconds later after wave 1 has ended, either 6 or 7 fairies spawn on wave 2. Once there are no more enemies on-screen, the stage section ends and Futo’s dialogue initiates. 

However, it is possible to start wave 2 without having killed all fairies on wave 1. In order to do it effectively, on wave 1, you must kill 4 fairies before the final 2 fairies spawn. The game counts the number of enemies on-screen and during the frame the final two fairies spawn, those two fairies aren’t run in the calculation (but this is only for 1 frame).*

![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")


**At the beginning of Stage 6**, you want to suicide to refill your bombs.

During the bomb spirit section, you must trance and get to a bomb count between 4 1/8 or 4 4/8. The safest bomb count to be at is 4 2/8 or 4 3/8. Right when it ends, you must go around the screen and refill your gauge for the next section.

This section is a tough section: you must take into account the bomb spirits you collect during and after the trance. Furthermore, you must have enough leftover spirits on-screen for the next section. In addition, you have to make sure to kill the big fairies as well since those can be a nuisance, especially when they are at the bottom of the screen.

**At the end of Stage 6**, you want to stream from left to right in order to kill all 4 life spirits around the centre of the screen. They must be killed as close to the centre as possible in order to maximise your damage output when trancing on Miko.

<h2>Boss Route</h2>


This part documents what you have to do on bosses.

Here is a table summarising the route. There are a few additional remarks which can be found below the table.

On **Kyouko**’s first non-spell, the trance also collects bomb spirits from the previous stage section.

**Yoshika**’s second spell is tricky to do. You start off point blanking her and the bomb is used right as she moves. During the bomb you want to move down to not get hit by any bullets. For the third spell, start the trance exactly one second after it has started. When the blue spirits are spawned, you must lean to the side where they spawn whilst shooting Yoshika. Once Yoshika attracts the spirits, you must move horizontally in a very vigorous manner. This way you will deal damage whilst picking up the majority of the spirits. 

On **Seiga**’s first non-spell, you need to trance one second after you are able to shoot. This way you will deal the right amount of damage to take down her first spell-card.

During the trance on **Futo**’s second non-spell, the player must be low enough for it to not collect any spirits. Once the trance ends, rush upwards and bomb twice. This stalling is done to guarantee a trance on her third non-spell. Likewise, the same thing is done during the trance on her third spell-card.

**Miko**’s first non starts off with a trance where you collect four life spirits at the same time.

On the third spell-card, you must stall for some spirits which will be used for a death trance on the fourth non-spell. The same thing can also be done on Miko’s sixth spell-card but it is not required.

For the final spell-card, the most optimal time to trance is right when Miko freezes the bullets on-screen. Unfortunately, no trance or bomb can be used for the final phase of NDS, so you must do it normally.

If you are playing on Easy mode you will have an extra life (since the suicide on Yuyuko cannot be done) you can go for a double KO, saving about .5s.
