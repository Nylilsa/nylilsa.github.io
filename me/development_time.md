## bugs and stuff

i really want to make the pages as accurate as possible. while it may be easy to summarize some bugs within a few lines, some readers might be more inclined to read more about it. it is exactly why i created this website to begin with, to provide accurate information about bugs i am well-versed with. 

but in order to create a sound and accurate page, i must put in a lot of time and effort that often goes overlooked.

This page details how long it takes for a page to be made. it will include examples of already-written pages and roughly how long it took, as well as the tools/time it took to create the page.


explain steps involved

researching:
1. knowing about the issue
2. hypothesizing the cause
3. analyzing any videos or replays
4. recreating the bug myself
5. analyzing and understanding the relevant code
6. verifying the cause of the bug
7. understanding the bug myself
8. creating a comprehensive page outline
9. gathering more media (images/videos/replays)
10. writing the full version given the page outline
11. re-reading the page for any inaccuracies or mistakes

These steps can sometimes be swapped around, e.g. step 2 and 3 could be swapped or steps 8 and 9 can be swapped, or maybe steps 4 and 1 could be swapped.

possible page examples:
1. th11: negative spell bonus (easy)
2. th10: stage 4 desync (bit harder)
3. th14: gohei dupe (took me weeks to understand)
