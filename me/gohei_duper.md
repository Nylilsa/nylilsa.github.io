## Introduction
[hr_minor]

We all know ReimuA DDC is goated. I mean, just _look_ at her. She has a massive Gohei that deals above average damage compared to the other shottypes.

But wait, the gohei isn't at its full potential - currently a part of it is hitting the boss. This is because the Gohei gets recoiled by the hitbox it is currently hitting. However, we can prevent this by [hl2]centering[/hl2] the gohei !

Now that gohei is used to its fullest potential, but our damage certainly isn't! We can also summon homing amulets by [hl2]shiftspamming[/hl2] quickly unshifting and shifting while keeping the gohei alive.

...alright, surely that must the maximum damage we can deal, right? We're getting the most out of our single gohei through [hl2]centering[/hl2], and at the same time we're shooting the amulets by [hl2]shiftspamming[/hl2]. There's nothing else we can do to achieve more damage it seems as we've quite literally run out of fire power.

...well, not quite.

There exists a GLITCH that allows for multiple goheis to be created. The glitch can create up to 4 goheis at once, and all of the goheis act the same way. The name of the glitch is also known as [hl2]Gohei duplication[/hl2] or [hl2]Gohei dupe[/hl2] or [hl2]dupe[/hl2] in short. For more details, see THIS PAGE.

## Gohei duplication glitch
[hr_minor]

This is an incredibly hard glitch to execute as there are a bunch of factors involved:

1. The player's y-coordinate
2. The distance between the gohei and a target
3. Your button mashing capabilities
4. Luck

Note that you don't need any enemies to be on-screen to perform the dupe glitch.

### y-coordinate
[hr_minor]

The gohei dupe can only be done [hl2]at specific heights[/hl2]. Below is an image that should roughly give you an indicator where to be if you want to do the dupe.

Since it's at quite a height it means you need to go to the top if you want to do the dupe glitch. If you want to do the dupe on bosses, it means you have to go to the top left or top right for it to work.

### Gohei-target distance
[hr_minor]

The gohei has a feature that, when shot, instantly centers on a target. You can see this if you are up-close to an enemy. This is good if you want to dump a gohei on an enemy real quick, but this makes it [hl2]impossible[/hl2] to do the gohei dupe glitch.

Instead, you want to have a great enough distance such that the gohei doesn't instantly goes towards the target.

### Button spamming
[hr_minor]

The general rule is that the faster you can mash your buttons the better it is. This section isn't very much about talking about the techniques of button mashing. For techniques of button spamming, you can find it in THIS section.

### Luck
[hr_minor]

Honestly, sometimes it doesn't really make much sense, but luck is involved when doing this glitch. You can do the exact same inputs twice, but in one instance you may only get 1 gohei and in the other you may be lucky to get 3 goheis. There isn't much else I can say, really...

## Guide?
[hr_minor]

Well, I might want to work on some guide on how to deal the most damage as ReimuA in the future, but I cannot guarantee anything yet. If I've made one I'll be sure to link it on this page!

## Sum of Best
[hr_minor]

Anyways, the reason why I wrote this is to keep track of my best Spell-card bonuses, or SCBs for short. I basically wanted to see how far I could reach the upper limit, where the upper limit is equal to the starting SCB value of a spell.
