[hr_major]  

Hello there, and thank you for checking out this little corner of the internet of mine !

The name is Nylilsa. I'm your average sleep-deprived college student with an inverted sleep schedule. (´｡• ᵕ •｡`)

I like making stuff, which explains why this website exists. I quite like random stuff that aren't really related to each other, such as photography, music, literature, linguistics and programming.

On top of this, I like playing games the unconventional way and exploring its limits. More specifically, I enjoy glitch hunting as it is just super interesting to see how badly you can break games. On top of this, I love the thought of TASing Touhou one day as TASes are very satisfying to watch (major thanks to [a=https://www.youtube.com/user/YouveBeenPlushed/]Plush[/a] and [a=https://www.youtube.com/user/pannenkeok2012]pannenkoek2012[/a]). I've lurked around in several communities before (few decent, most atrocious) but I do mostly feel welcome here !

All Touhou games are quite fun, but in particular I enjoy the ones that have the most interesting mechanics in them (thanks to a special someone, you know who you are). Especially games that can be speedrun that does not only use bombs on bosses are the ones that are the most fun to play for me.
There's a few games that I do love to score as well, which is usually in games where the runs are done quickly.

Also, I may not be that good of a player so don't expect too much. I only play because I enjoy the things I do !

## About this Website
[hr_minor]

### World Record Progression

There is a section titled World Record Progression. On this page, you will find a comprehensive Touhou world records tracker, updated every so often. The page includes an interactive graph and a table of your selected game along with [hl2]replay support[/hl2] for the WR entries ! Please feel free to check it out as this is the cumulation of about a year's worth of hard work from replay gathering, replay processing, file management, score gathering, etc. !

### Bugs/Glitch

On this website, you will find all documented glitches I have been able to find of Touhou Project. Additionally, there are a few guides written on various topics that are not necessarily related to one another.

### Guides

Sometimes I will write guides. They will all be posted here on this website. If you wish for a guide of yours to be posted on this website, please contact me and we can talk about it.

### Patches

If I ever make patches (probably, thanks to [a=https://exphp.github.io/thpages/#/]ExpHP[/a] and [a=https://priw8.github.io/#s=/index]Priw8[/a]), a list of my patches will be compiled on this website.
