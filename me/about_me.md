[hr_major]  

Hello there and welcome to this little corner of the internet of mine !

The name is Nylilsa. I'm your average Dutch sleep-deprived college student. (´｡• ᵕ •｡`)

I like making stuff, which explains why this website exists. I quite like random stuff that aren't really related to each other, such as photography, literature, linguistics and programming (programming to a degree because I'm still new to it. lol).

On top of this, I like playing games the unconventional way and exploring its limits. More specifically, I enjoy glitch hunting as it is just super interesting to see how badly you can break games. On top of this, I love the thought of TASing Touhou one day as TASes are very satisfying to watch (major thanks to [a=https://www.youtube.com/user/YouveBeenPlushed/]Plush[/a] and [a=https://www.youtube.com/user/pannenkeok2012]pannenkoek2012[/a]). I've lurked around in several communities before (few decent, most atrocious) but I do feel welcome here.

All Touhou games are quite fun, but in particular I enjoy the ones that have the most interesting mechanics in them. Especially games that can be speedrun that does not only use bombs on bosses are the ones that are the most fun to play for me.
There's a few games that I do love to score as well, which is usually in games where the runs are done quickly.

Also, I'm not too good of a player so don't expect too much. I want to enjoy the things I do !
