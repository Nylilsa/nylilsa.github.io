Hi there, if you don't recognise the name Plus [hl2]I recommend you to close this page[/hl2]. If you do recognise the name then this page might interest you.

I used to go by the name of Plus a while ago, but I grew uncomfortable with this name. The reason being that I wanted to run away from problems that I have created. I succeeded, but on the inside I knew this success would only be temporary. I easily became detached from the identity that Plus resembled and instead found solace in my current name Nylilsa. I soon forgot about a lot of things I did as Plus and became Nylilsa instead. I know that some people have found it sketchy that I had suddenly changed identity like this, some possibly think I had done it with malicious intent. Others would get a wrong impression of me, and rightfully so. Only now at the very start of 2025 have I decided to write about this. Why is that you may ask ? I am doing this not to pointlessly beg for forgiveness to those I've hurt. I know it would be pointless to even consider it as it would lead to more conflict. I've run away from problems for years and years, but deep inside I know that it's pointless to hide myself from my problems like a coward. Hiding yourself from problems you have created only creates more problems, and those problems end up crippling you from the inside. Instead, I am doing this confession purely to become a better person myself, and I can say with confidence that writing this out feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I am fully aware that by writing all of this publicly I won't convince any people that I'm a good person (I may do the opposite in fact), but instead I am doing what feels like is the objectively right thing to do: start with a clean slate.

If you happen to be one of the people I hurt, I want to let you know that I feel remorse for my actions and that I take full responsibility for them. I would love to do something to repay you, but I understand if you do not want to talk to me anymore: it's the better for both of us. In the unlikely scenario that you do want to talk, I will be welcoming you at [discord] on Discord.

Thank you for reading this and I hope you have a nice day.
