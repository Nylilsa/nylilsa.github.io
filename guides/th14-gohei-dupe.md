## Introduction
[hr_minor]

DDC ReimuA has a massive Gohei that deals above average damage compared to the other shottypes in this game.

But wait, the gohei isn't at its full potential - currently a part of it is hitting the boss. This is because the Gohei gets recoiled by the hitbox it is currently hitting. However, we can prevent this by [hl2]centering[/hl2] the gohei !

Now that gohei is used to its fullest potential, but our damage certainly isn't. We can also summon homing amulets by [hl2]shift tapping[/hl2]: we quickly alter between unshifting and shifting to keep the gohei alive !

...alright, surely that must the maximum damage we can deal, right ? We're getting the most out of our single gohei through [hl2]centering[/hl2], and at the same time we're shooting the amulets by [hl2]shift tapping[/hl2]. There's nothing else we can do to achieve more damage it seems as we've quite run out of fire power.

...well, not quite.

There exists a [a=/#/bugs/th14/gohei-dupe]glitch[/a] that allows for multiple goheis to be created. The glitch can create up to 4 goheis at once, and all of the goheis act the same way. The name of the glitch is also known as [hl2]Gohei duplication[/hl2] or [hl2]Gohei dupe[/hl2] or [hl2]dupe[/hl2] in short.

## Video
[hr_minor]

Below shows a video showing varying methods on how to deal damage as ReimuA:

[video=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Swh3whaeXcQ, hratio=2, other=width:720px; aspect-ratio:16/9]

The video above demonstrates the different ways ReimuA can maximise her damage. The times mentioned below is the same time I got in this video but two seconds are subtracted from it. This was done because Seija starts off with invincibility frames for one second, and her death animation lasts for one second.

| Method nr | Description                                | Time   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Method 1  | Focus only + no amulets                | 20.41s |
| Method 2  | Re-centering + no amulets              | 16.16s |
| Method 3  | No centering + amulets                 | 15.46s |
| Method 4  | 0/2 centered double gohei + no amulets | 14.01s |
| Method 5  | Centering + amulets                    | 13.68s |
| Method 6  | 0/2 centered double gohei + amulets    | 12.01s |
| Method 7  | 2/2 centered double gohei + amulets    | 10.63s |
| Method 8  | 0/3 centered triple gohei + amulets    | 9.10s  |
| Method 9  | 3/3 centered triple gohei + amulets    | 8.25s  |

There are some things to keep note of though.

Method 2 and method 5 are [hl2]only possible if the player can go high enough[/hl2] to reach the boss. This is possible on most patterns except those that force the player to be low on-screen.
While method 7 and method 9 are extremely powerful, [hl2]their additional power comes from the first couple of seconds[/hl2] in which the goheis are centered. After those couple seconds the goheis slowly diverge from the boss and less DPS is dealt to the boss. In this video, the 2/2 centered double gohei is about 12.9% faster than the 0/2 centered double gohei method, but I chose a different attack that has more HP, then the ratio would be less than 12.9% because the 2/2 centered double gohei only deals more damage at the beginning of the attack.

## Gohei duplication glitch
[hr_minor]

This is tricky glitch to execute as there are a bunch of factors involved, and [hl2]for simplicity's sake[/hl2] I numbed them down to the following factors:

1. The player's y-coordinate
2. The distance between the gohei and a target
3. Your button tapping ability

Note that [hl2]this is a very very numbed down version on the gohei dupe[/hl2]. The actual cause of it [jumpto=#/bugs/th14/gohei-dupe#howithappens]can be found here[/jumpto].

### Player's y-coordinate
[hr_minor]

The gohei dupe can consistently be done [hl2]at specific heights[/hl2]. Below is an image that should roughly give you an indicator where to be if you want to do the dupe.

[img=me/range.png, figtitle=The height range (in red) required for the player to be at for the dupe to take place, alt=An ingame screenshot with a red bar across the top of the screen] [br]

Since it's at quite a height it means you need to go to the top if you want to do the dupe glitch. If you want to do the dupe on bosses, it means you have to go to the top left or top right for it to work.

### Gohei-target distance
[hr_minor]

The gohei has a feature that, when shot, [hl2]instantly centers on a target[/hl2]. If the gohei is 160 units within an enemy, the gohei instantly locks into the enemy. You can see this if you are up-close to an enemy. This is good if you want to dump a gohei on an enemy real quick, but this makes it [hl2]impossible[/hl2] to do the gohei dupe glitch.

[img=bugs/th14/4_radii.png, figtitle=A comparison between a radius of 160 units (blue) with a radius of 320 units (orange). The 160 unit radius check happens on [hl2]the gohei spawning location[/hl2], which is right in ReimuA. The 320 unit radius check happens at the gohei's position., alt=A game screenshot showing two colored circles around ReimuA's gohei] 

Instead, you want to be at least 160 units away from enemies so the gohei doesn't instantly goes towards the target.

### Button tapping
[hr_minor]

There's only two relevant buttons for the dupe: [key=Z] and [key=Shift].

You want to hold the [key=Z] key, but the [key=Shift] key is the key you want to tap. The general rule is that the faster you can tap [key=Shift] it is, but to do the gohei dupe [hl2]you do not have to tap as quickly as possible ![/hl2] The dupe is possible with minimal inputs, which I will show later.

I average about 11 clicks per second on my [key=Shift] key, though [hl2]it is possible with just 5 clicks per second[/hl2]. If you want to check out what your clicks per second is, you can check it out on [a=https://cps-check.com/keyboard-cps]this website[/a].

## Basic setup
[hr_minor]

I recommend practicing the dupe glitch on Shinmyoumaru's second non-spell because there is a safespot that allows for easy practice, she does not more and she has a lot of HP. You can warp to this non-spell using [a=https://github.com/touhouworldcup/thprac]the practice tool thprac[/a].

[br]

My personal preference is to both tap Z and Shift at once, but [hl2]you only need to tap Shift[/hl2]. You can just hold Z all the time.
The easiest technique I found to get a double gohei requires the least amount of inputs. Here's how to do it:
1. Get into the right position
2. Hover your fingers over the Shift and the Z keys
3. Hold Shift
4. Hold Z
5. Unhold Shift
6. Hold Shift again

You need to do steps 3-6 within a short time, like 0.2s. With this setup you are only able to [hl2]yield 2 goheis at most[/hl2], which is what the goal of this is. If you want to generate more than 2 goheis you preferably want to repeat steps 5-6 multiple times in a really short time, [hl2]roughly 0.05s or less[/hl2] between taps.

It may be hard to know if you got one or two goheis, so here are some ways you can tell how many you have:
1. You [hl2]hear a lot more noise[/hl2]. Hit a boss with a single gohei and you hear a few damage ticks every second, but if you have two goheis or more you will hear more damage ticks.
2. If you have some experience on a boss you can tell the [hl2]significant increase in damage[/hl2] that you are dealing
3. Visually, you will notice that [hl2]the gohei looks denser[/hl2]
4. Right as you are doing the dupe, you will notice the individual goheis spawning, but this might be hard to tell
5. The goheis may split up, which reveals that there are multiple goheis

So yeah, that was everything I had to say about it. If there's something you wonder about and want to ask you can do so by contacting my Discord [discord] !

Good luck and have fun with this trick !
