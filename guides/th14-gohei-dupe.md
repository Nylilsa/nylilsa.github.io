## Introduction
[hr_minor]

DDC ReimuA has a massive Gohei that deals above average damage compared to the other shottypes in this game.

[img=me/gohei.png, figtitle=ReimuA's gohei, which you spawn by shooting focussed, alt=A screenshot of Kagerou being attacked by ReimuA]

But wait, the gohei isn't at its full potential - currently a part of it is hitting the boss. This is because the Gohei gets recoiled by the hitbox it is currently hitting. However, we can prevent this by [hl2]centering[/hl2] the gohei !

[img=me/gohei_center.png, figtitle=The gohei is centered onto the boss, alt=A screenshot of Sekibanki being attacked by ReimuA]

Now that gohei is used to its fullest potential, but our damage certainly isn't. We can also summon homing amulets by [hl2]shift tapping[/hl2]: we quickly alter between unshifting and shifting to keep the gohei alive !

[img=me/gohei_amulets.png, figtitle=Shift tapping is done to spawn more amulets, alt=A screenshot of ReimuA spawning amulets]

...alright, surely that must the maximum damage we can deal, right ? We're getting the most out of our single gohei through [hl2]centering[/hl2], and at the same time we're shooting the amulets by [hl2]shift tapping[/hl2]. There's nothing else we can do to achieve more damage it seems as we've quite run out of fire power.

...well, not quite.

[a=/#/bugs/th14/gohei-dupe]There exists a glitch[/a] that allows for multiple goheis to be created. The name of the glitch is also known as [hl2]Gohei duplication[/hl2] or [hl2]Gohei dupe[/hl2] or [hl2]dupe[/hl2] in short.

## Video
[hr_minor]

Below shows a video showing varying methods on how to deal damage as ReimuA:

[video=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Swh3whaeXcQ, hratio=2, other=width:720px; aspect-ratio:16/9]

The video above demonstrates the different ways ReimuA can maximise her damage. The times mentioned below is the same time I got in this video but two seconds are subtracted from it. This was done because Seija starts off with invincibility frames for one second, and her death animation lasts for one second.

| Method nr | Description                            | Time   |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Method 1  | Focus only + no amulets                | 20.41s |
| Method 2  | Re-centering + no amulets              | 16.16s |
| Method 3  | No centering + amulets                 | 15.46s |
| Method 4  | 0/2 centered double gohei + no amulets | 14.01s |
| Method 5  | Centering + amulets                    | 13.68s |
| Method 6  | 0/2 centered double gohei + amulets    | 12.01s |
| Method 7  | 2/2 centered double gohei + amulets    | 10.63s |
| Method 8  | 0/3 centered triple gohei + amulets    | 9.10s  |
| Method 9  | 3/3 centered triple gohei + amulets    | 8.25s  |

There are some things to keep note of though.

Method 2 and method 5 are [hl2]only possible if the player can go high enough[/hl2] to reach the boss. This is possible on most patterns except those that force the player to be low on-screen.
While method 7 and method 9 are extremely powerful, [hl2]their additional power comes from the first couple of seconds[/hl2] in which the goheis are centered. After those couple seconds the goheis slowly diverge from the boss and less DPS is dealt to the boss. In this video, the 2/2 centered double gohei is about 12.9% faster than the 0/2 centered double gohei method, but I chose a different attack that has more HP, then the ratio would be less than 12.9% because the 2/2 centered double gohei only deals more damage at the beginning of the attack.

## Gohei duplication glitch
[hr_minor]

This is tricky glitch to execute as there are a bunch of factors involved, and [hl2]for simplicity's sake[/hl2] I numbed them down to the following factors:

1. The player's y-coordinate
2. The distance between the gohei and a target
3. Your button tapping ability

Note that [hl2]this is a very very numbed down version on the gohei dupe[/hl2]. The actual cause of it [jumpto=#/bugs/th14/gohei-dupe#howithappens]can be found here[/jumpto].

### Player's y-coordinate
[hr_minor]

The gohei dupe can consistently be done [hl2]at specific heights[/hl2]. Below is an image that should roughly give you an indicator where to be if you want to do the dupe.

[img=me/range.png, figtitle=The height range (in red) required for the player to be at for the dupe to take place, alt=An ingame screenshot with a red bar across the top of the screen]

Since it's at quite a height it means you need to go to the top if you want to do the dupe glitch. If you want to do the dupe on bosses, it means you have to go to the top left or top right for it to work.

### Gohei-target distance
[hr_minor]

The gohei has a feature that, when shot, [hl2]instantly centers on a target[/hl2]. If the gohei is 160 units within an enemy, the gohei instantly locks into the enemy. You can see this if you are up-close to an enemy. This is good if you want to dump a gohei on an enemy real quick, but this makes it [hl2]impossible[/hl2] to do the gohei dupe glitch.

[img=bugs/th14/4_radii.png, figtitle=A comparison between a radius of 160 units (blue) with a radius of 320 units (orange). The 160 unit radius check happens on [hl2]the gohei spawning location[/hl2], which is right in ReimuA. The 320 unit radius check happens at the gohei's position., alt=A game screenshot showing two colored circles around ReimuA's gohei] 

Instead, you want to be at least 160 units away from enemies so the gohei doesn't instantly goes towards the target.

### Button tapping
[hr_minor]

There's only two relevant buttons for the dupe: [key=Z] and [key=Shift].

You want to hold the [key=Z] key, and tap with the [key=Shift] key. The general rule is that the faster you can tap [key=Shift] it is, but to do the gohei dupe [hl2]you do not have to tap as quickly as possible ![/hl2] The dupe is possible with minimal inputs, which I will show later.

I average about 11 clicks per second on my [key=Shift] key, though [hl2]it is possible with just 5 clicks per second[/hl2]. If you want to check out what your clicks per second is, you can check it out on [a=https://cps-check.com/keyboard-cps]this website[/a].

## Different techniques
[hr_minor]

Below I will provide a few different techniques ranging from basic techniques to advanced techniques, where basic is for those who are just getting started and advanced are for those who want to become well-versed with this.

### Basic techniques
[hr_minor]

I recommend practicing the dupe glitch on Shinmyoumaru's second non-spell because there is a safespot that allows for easy practice, she does not move and she has a lot of HP. You can warp to this non-spell using [a=https://github.com/touhouworldcup/thprac]the practice tool thprac[/a].

[img=guides/th14-gohei-dupe/safespot.png, figtitle=A safespot on Shinmyoumaru's second non-spell, alt=Reimu and Shinmyoumaru]

My personal preference is to both tap Z and Shift at once, but [hl2]you can also choose to only tap Shift[/hl2]. Preferably, you want to hold Z all the time.
The easiest technique I found to get a double gohei is something I call the [hl2]Shift-Z-Shift method[/hl2]. Here's how to do it:
1. Get into the correct position
2. Hover your fingers over the Shift and the Z keys
3. Hold Shift
4. Hold Z
5. Unhold Shift
6. Hold Shift again

You need to do steps 3-6 within a short time, like 0.2s. With this technique you are only able to [hl2]yield 2 goheis at most[/hl2], which is what the goal of this section is.

Alternatively, the following technique also works (which I will call the [hl2]Double tap method[/hl2]), but from my experience it is less consistent than the aforementioned technique:
1. Get into the correct position
2. Hover your fingers over the Shift and the Z keys
3. Hold Z and Shift at the same time
4. Release Z and Shift at the same time
5. Hold Z and Shift at the same time, again.

Here is a video showcasing the double gohei using the [hl2]Shift-Z-Shift[/hl2] method:

[video=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qhwndHruaxU, hratio=2, other=width:720px; aspect-ratio:16/9]

Note that I only used a bomb at the start to skip the first phase of the attack. Also, [hl2]I did not get a double gohei every time[/hl2], instead I got it about 40% of the time. 

Congratulations! You have learnt the basics on how to obtain a double gohei. If you want to learn more on how to get the most out of the double gohei, please read the next section.

### Intermediate techniques
[hr_minor]

Solely getting the double gohei won't be very beneficial if you cannot make the most out of it. This section is going to tell you how you can make the most out of our double gohei, as well as a new technique allowing for more consistent double goheis.

#### Gohei maintenance
[hr_minor]

A common mistake I see is that people tend to glue their finger to the Shift key, avoiding losing the double gohei. This has its own problems, mainly limiting player movement and lowering your potential DPS. Another mistake this is that, if the player has to make a sudden dash, they would release Shift for too long, losing the double gohei.

[img=guides/th14-gohei-dupe/button_state_chart_dash.png, figtitle=A graph representation of a player doing a dash (on frame 15) in which the player is unfocussed for too long, resulting in the gohei(s) despawning, alt=A chart with the y-axis showing the button state and the x-axis showing time]

The goal of this section is to prevent your gohei from accidentally despawning. If you want to get better at this I recommend you to practice patterns that involve a lot of movement while trying to maintain your gohei(s), such as Kagerou's mid-spell-card or Kagerou's third spell-card. Try to get a rhythm for how long you can unfocus for before the gohei(s) despawn.

#### Amulet shift tapping
[hr_minor]

While being unfocussed may put you at risk for despawning your gohei, being unfocussed also generates a lot of homing amulets that deal additional damage. It is therefore at our best interest to unfocus for as long as possible while making sure the gohei does not despawn.

I recommend to shift tap at a sustainable frequency of 4-5Hz: any less and you greatly risk the chance of losing your goheis, while doing it any higher may increase fatigue in your fingers as well as less DPS due to Shift being held more than needed. 

Tapping at the correct frequency is only the first part. If a player is not used to shift tapping, they might shift tap at a sustainable frequency but the interval might be too short, meaning few amulets are generated.

[img=guides/th14-gohei-dupe/button_state_chart_few_amulets.png, figtitle=A graph representation of a player shift tapping at 5hz with an average interval of 3.2 frames, meaning very few amulets were generated, alt=A chart with the y-axis showing the button state and the x-axis showing time] 

In contrast, a more experienced player may shift tap at a similar frequency but at a much longer interval, resulting in more amulets being generated.

[img=guides/th14-gohei-dupe/button_state_chart_many_amulets.png, figtitle=A graph representation of a player shift tapping at 5hz with an average interval of 8.6 frames, meaning many amulets were generated, alt=A chart with the y-axis showing the button state and the x-axis showing time]

This method can be improved by simply increasing the time during the interval. A simply way to tell if you are doing it correctly is by looking at the amount of amulets generated between every Shift tap. If the amount of amulets looks very similar to being fully unfocussed, you are on the right track !

#### Better gohei dupe technique
[hr_minor]

The following gohei dupe technique is something I commonly use, which I will call the [hl2]Triple tap method[/hl2]:
1. Get into the correct position
2. Hover your fingers over the Shift and the Z keys
3. Hold Z and Shift at the same time
4. Release Z and Shift at the same time
5. Hold Z and Shift at the same time, again.
6. Release Z and Shift at the same time, again
7. Hold Z and Shift at the same time, once again.

Steps 3-7 need to be done within a short time, like 0.25s. With this technique you are only able to [hl2]yield 3 goheis at most[/hl2].

This is personally my most commonly used method if I want to get a double gohei. This is much more consistent than the previous methods, because in this case you are rolling for a double gohei twice, and a triple gohei once. This triple tap method is a little bit more intensive, but with practice it will get easier.

### Advanced techniques
[hr_minor]

gohei reset timer: time between duping attempts
feeling the difference between 1/2/3 goheis
centered gohei
4 tap method

It may be hard to know if you got one or two goheis, so here are some ways you can tell how many you have:
1. You [hl2]hear a lot more noise[/hl2]. Hit a boss with a single gohei and you hear a few damage ticks every second, but if you have two goheis or more you will hear more damage ticks.
2. If you have some experience on a boss you can tell the [hl2]significant increase in damage[/hl2] that you are dealing.
3. Visually, you will notice that [hl2]the gohei looks denser[/hl2].
4. Right as you are doing the dupe, you will notice the individual goheis spawning, but this might be hard to tell.
5. The goheis may split up, which reveals that there are multiple goheis.

So yeah, that was everything I had to say about it. If there's something you wonder about and want to ask you can do so by contacting my Discord [discord] !

Good luck and have fun with this trick !
