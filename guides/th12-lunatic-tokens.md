UFO tokens can come in two states: static and blinking. When a UFO token is static it means that its color never changed. In contrast, if a UFO token is blinking it means that its color changes. Its color cycle is as follows: Red -> Blue -> Green -> Red. The blinking UFO tokens change color after a period of time. This period of time is halted when the player is nearby the UFO token.
