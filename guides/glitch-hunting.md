[hr_major]  

This guide focuses on glitch-hunting in the Touhou Project games.


### idk where to put this

[non-linear thinking]
if game wants you to do A, you do C
instead of continuously playing LoLK Reimu Lunatic NB, try other stuff. lol

## researching

[be familiar with chosen game]
[look at wiki(s) at their respective Glitches section]
[google for old threads]
[talk to ones that have a lot of experience in the game]

## doing it yourself

[examine code]
youll find wack stuff in zuncode

[look at transitions]
lolk paint bug, um d press desync, eosd/pcb/in pause menu glitch

[look if variables reset or do not reset]
manual glitch, cards in shop do not restock when esc + r, blank card + reset does stuff

[frame-perfect actions]
breaking hyper as you get hit in wbawc, pressing x as you get hit in DDC as SakuyaA

[ask yourself questions]
"Someone else just found a cool glitch. Are there other places that glitch could be useful?"
manual glitch made me found out that you can do extra on point device
also, it made me found out about the pause desync thing when i found out about the weird visual bug most common in hsifs/wbawc/um spell prac
