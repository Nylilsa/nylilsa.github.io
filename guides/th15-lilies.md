Pure Sign "Lilies of Murderous Intent" or "Lilies" in short is Junko's 2nd spell-card in the game Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom. Lilies is a pattern that involves misdirection of bullets and it involves one or two hard waves of a bunch of lasers. In this guide I will share you the method I use to misdirect the bullets and what I do on the hard waves. This guide will contain a lot of examples that showcase different cases that could save your run if you are prepared for it!


include following:
pattern breakdown (waves 1-4), random movement 
big wave
note that lasers spawn in a certain order

generic methods:
talk about the most used method (left right left right corner)
1. failed misdirect puts your character in danger
2. you have to move a lot so you deal less dmg
3. you are very low
you will kill it in 1 or 2 waves

the big wave
either dodge in middle or on side. if junko in middle go in middle else go to side

my method:
1. dodge higher up so you move less and can deal more damage
2. misdirect to the side !
3. 

why?
if you accidentally misdirect to the side and you are not used to it you will die
misdirecting it to the side can be beneficial (e.g. when you are in a very tight spot)
