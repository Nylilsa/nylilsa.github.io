## [what]
[hr_minor]

The displayed score overflows and becomes its value minus ``4,294,967,296 ``. The player's actual score is unaffected and is displayed normally on the player data and replay screens.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

This happens if the current score internally is ``2,147,483,648`` or higher.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

In UFO, the score and highscore are stored as 32-bit unsigned integers. This means its values can only be in the range from ``0`` to ``4,294,967,295``, in total having ``2^32`` possibilities.[br]

### Score Display vs Internal Score
[hr_minor]

The score displayed in the top right of the screen is different from how score is stored internally. Take for example, the score ``1,234,560`` that is shown in the display. This score is actually internally stored as the integer ``123 456``, so the same as ``1 234 560`` but without the trailing zero.

Because of this difference, the score shown on the player data and replay screens are accurate as the internally stored score is used.

### Integer Overflow
[hr_minor]

The displayed score treats the score differently. Instead, imagine the number displayed is the same number stored internally. We will call the number shown in the top right screen to be **SD** for **Score Display**.
The number SD is stored as a 32-bit signed integer. This means its values can only be in the range from from ``-2,147,483,648`` to ``2,147,483,647``, in total having ``2^32`` possibilities.

Since score can take values from the range ``[-2,147,483,648; 2,147,483,647]`` values that go above the limit of ``2,147,483,647`` is called integer overflow. Values that go below the limit of ``-2,147,483,648`` is called integer underflow.

The positive numbers from the ramge ``[0; 2,147,483,647]`` are represented by the bit patterns ``[0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000; 0111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111]``[sub]2[/sub]. 
The negative numbers from the range ``[-2,147,483,648; -1]`` are represented by the bit patterns ``[1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000; 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111]``[sub]2[/sub]. 

Suppose the current number of the SD is equal to ``2,147,483,647``, so ``0111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111``[sub]2[/sub] in binary. If the player gains 1 more score, its value will be ``1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000``[sub]2[/sub] in binary. Because of this, the score displays the negative number ``-2,147,483,648`` as its score.
