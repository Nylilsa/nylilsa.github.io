## [what]
[hr_minor]

This desync only happens when [hl2]starting a replay directly from Stage 4[/hl2], in which case the player dies to the first few fairies that spawn. The replay would otherwise work normally when started on any other stage, assuming no other desync takes place. This desync does not apply to Practice Mode replays.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

For this desync, the [hl2]player must die[/hl2] by any of the first two fairies by ramming into the fairy.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

When starting a replay from any stage, the player character is given 120 frames of invincibility. When ramming into the fairy normally, the player dies the moment contact is made with the fairy. However, when ramming into the fairy starting the replay from Stage 4, the player can either [hl2]go through the fairy and survive[/hl2], or [hl2]still die to the fairy but a few frames later[/hl2]. Regardless, both options result in a different outcome than what the original, causing the desync.
