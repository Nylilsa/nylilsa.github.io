## [what]
[hr_minor]

Merlin behaves weirdly during and after the final spell-card. There have been a number of reports in which Merlin misbehaved.

She once kept moving around in circles, even after her final spell-card had happened.
She used her attack of the penultimate spell-card during the final spell-card.
She did not despawn after the final spell-card.


## [how]
[hr_minor]

It is assumed that it has to do with the Prismriver's last spell-card. Also, it is assumed that this can only be replicated as Sakuya.


## [why_idk]
[hr_minor]

It is hypothesised that this glitch only takes place when playing as Sakuya. This suggests that this glitch is partly caused by Merlin's 1st or 2nd non-spell.
Furthermore, based on my personal testing, the trigger to this glitch seem to be triggered on the second spell-card of her solo card.
