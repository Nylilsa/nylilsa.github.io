## [what]
[hr_minor]

By pausing during dialogue in-game, this may result in a desync. The desync may not be noticeable until (very) late into the boss.  

## [how]
[hr_minor]

The desync is caused by holding the shoot button [key=Z] while the game is exiting out of the pause menu. In particular, the player commonly holds [key=Z] when pressing on the "Resume to game" option in the pause menu.


## [why]
[hr_minor]

This desync has to do with how the game handles its button events.
In the games EoSD, PCB and IN, the [hl2]button events are still registered while paused[/hl2]. This is not the case in modern games.

### Button events
[hr_minor]

There are three button events:
1. Key is pressed 
2. Key is held
3. Key is released

Here are some actions that are done when a [hl2]key is held[/hl2]:
+ Player shooting
+ Player moving
+ Skipping through dialogue (by using [key=Ctrl] button)

Here is an action that is done when a [hl2]key is pressed[/hl2]:
+ [hl2]Skipping through dialogue (by using [key=Z] button)[/hl2]

### Live playthrough
[hr_minor]

Consider the following table of a player pausing mid-game during dialogue:

| Global timer     | 1 | 2 | 3 | [hl1]4[/hl1] | [hl1]5[/hl1] | [hl1]6[/hl1] | 7 | 8 |
|------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| In-game timer    | 1 | 2 | 3 | [hl1]3[/hl1] | [hl1]3[/hl1] | [hl1]3[/hl1] | 4 | 5 |
| Is Z button held?|  :NO: | :NO:  | :NO:  | [hl1]:NO:[/hl1]  | [hl1]:YES:[/hl1]  | [hl1]:YES:[/hl1]  | :YES:  | :YES:  |


[br] The ``Global timer`` is a value that increases by ``1`` every frame.
The ``In-game timer`` is a value that increases by ``1`` every frame unless the game is paused.
The ``Is Z button held?`` is a value that is either True (marked with :YES:) or False (marked with :NO:).

The three highlighted columns indicate that the game is [hl2]paused[/hl2] The game is paused in the Global Timer interval ``[4, 6]``


When skipping through dialogue by pressing the [key=Z] button, The [key=Z] key [hl2]must be pressed[/hl2] This means that one frame before [key=Z] is ":YES:", [key=Z] must be ":NO:". for it to be a [key=Z] [hl2]press[/hl2].
When the ``Global timer`` is equal to ``7``, the game is no longer paused. The game then checks if [key=Z] is pressed. For this, the game checks the following two conditions:
1. ``Is Z button held?`` = :YES: on ``Global timer`` = ``7``;
2. ``Is Z button held?`` = :NO: on ``Global timer`` = ``6``.

The second condition is not met, [hl2]so [key=Z] is not pressed[/hl2] This means that [hl2]the dialogue is not skipped while playing the game yourself[/hl2].

### Replay mode
[hr_minor]

Consider the same table from before:

| Global timer     | 1 | 2 | 3 | [c=invis]4[/c] | [c=invis]5[/c] | [c=invis]6[/c] | 7 | 8 |
|------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| In-game timer    | 1 | 2 | 3 | [c=invis]3[/c] | [c=invis]3[/c] | [c=invis]3[/c] | 4 | 5 |
| Is Z button held?|  :NO: | :NO:  | :NO:  | [c=invis]:NO:[/c]  | [c=invis]:YES:[/c]  | [c=invis]:YES:[/c]  | :YES:  | :YES:  |

[br] The four previously highlighted columns [hl2]are left out[/hl2] intentionally. [hl2]When watching a replay, the game does not take into account the button presses while pausing[/hl2]. Because of this, we don't look at the ``Global timer`` value, but we instead look at the value of ``In-game timer``.


When the ``In-game timer`` is equal to ``4``, the game is no longer paused. The game then checks if [key=Z] is pressed. For this, the game checks the following two conditions:
1. ``Is Z button held?`` = :YES: on ``In-game timer`` = ``4``;
2. ``Is Z button held?`` = :NO: on ``In-game timer`` = ``3``.

All two conditions are met, [hl2]so [key=Z] is pressed[/hl2] This means that [hl2]the dialogue is skipped while in replay mode[/hl2]


### Conclusion
[hr_minor]

In conclusion:
+ [key=Z] [hl2]is not pressed[/hl2] while playing the game on dialogue.
+ [key=Z] [hl2]is pressed[/hl2] while watching the replay on dialogue.

The inputs are the same in both cases, but its effect is different due to the fact [key=Z] must be pressed. This causes the desync glitch.
