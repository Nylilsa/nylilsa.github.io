## [what] 
[hr_minor]

Both Mai and Satono's 2nd solo spells, ``Star Festival`` and ``Behind You``, have issues with their timers. 

Star Festival displays a ``30`` second timer and once 30 seconds is up, the spell is counted as a fail
however, the timer resets and the pattern continues for another 10 seconds. It's is different in Spell Practice than in stage practice.
In Spell Practice the game removes the bullets and spell background and the timer is set to 10 seconds.
In Stage practice the spell continues for another 10 seconds without any interruptions however the timer displays 30 seconds. It still ends after 10 seconds despite the display.

Behind You displays a 40 second timer however the spell times out at 30 seconds. Like Star Festival it's different in stage and spell practice.
In Spell Practice the bullets, spell background, and timer disapear once 30 seconds is up. The pattern coninues for another 10 seconds like normal.
In Stage practice it continues like normal but the spell is counted as a fail after 30 seconds. The timer continues like normal.

Killing either pattern off after they "timeout" doesn't cause anything special. Although in Spell Practice they both vanish without any effects or noise.
