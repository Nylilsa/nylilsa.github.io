## [what] 
[hr_minor]

It is possible for the game to crash mid-run. This crash is only known to happen in two places of the game: in Stage 3 and in Stage 5.
In stage 3, the crash may happen after the mid-boss during the four fairies section.
In stage 5, the crash may happen during the laser spam section before the mid-boss.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

The crashes are triggered as follows:

Stage 3 crash: on Lunatic, the player must have chosen Spring as their subshot, the player must stay in the middle, and enough bullets need to have spawned. When there are enough bullets on-screen, the player should release. If done correctly, the game crashes.
Stage 5 crash: on Lunatic, the player must die at a particular point during the laser section. When the death is well-timed, the game crashes.

It is important to note that during both sections [hl2]there is a lot of action going on[/hl2]. On the Stage 3 crash, there are a lot of sprites that have spawned as a result from having cancelled the bullets. On the Stage 5 crash, a lot of lasers are cancelled at once.

Since the glitch is about a crash, it is not really possible to get a replay from it.
