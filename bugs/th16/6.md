## [what]
[hr_minor]

The float variable [ins=2, n=2] determines how fast the game runs. Though, [ins=2, n=2] does not simply change the game's FPS - it works through ZUN's ways.

The variable [ins=2, n=2] in HSiFS changes in the following events:
1. Outside of Spell practice mode, In the main game, Okina depletes to 0 HP or the timer reaches 00.00s on her final spell card (``[ins=2, n=2] = 0.5``), lasting for 60 frames.
2. Outside of Spell practice mode, In the main game, Okina explodes after her final spell card (``[ins=2, n=2] = 0.25``), lasting for 30 frames.
3. Outside of Spell practice mode, In Extra mode, Okina explodes after her final spell card (``[ins=2, n=2] = 0.25``), lasting for 30 frames.

Doing certain actions when [ins=2, n=2] is not ``1`` results in weird behaviour. This page describes changes around items as a result of this effect.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

During times when [ins=2, n=2] is not ``1`` the following side effects happen.

+ The player loses more power upon death in multiples of ``50``;
+ The player spawns more power items upon death in multiples of ``7``;

## [why]
[hr_minor]

Suppose that the value [ins=2, n=2] is set to ``0.25``. This means the game runs ``4`` times slower. The game usually executes the power drop/power loss effects for one frame upon death. However, because the game is ``4`` times slower it means that the game executes it ``4`` times instead of the usual ``1`` time. This means that the player ends up losing 200 power but gains 28 power. Note that this happens because the value of [ins=2, n=2] is changed. If the game's Frames Per Second (FPS) were changed through external means, then the same effect does not happen.
