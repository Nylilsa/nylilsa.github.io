## [what]

The player dies whilst breaking their hyper. It is not possible to escape the death through death-bombing. 

## [how]

The moment the player is hit whilst manually breaking the hyper kills the player.

## [why_idk]

Presumably during the first frame of the intentional hyper break the invincibility frames of the hyper break haven't initialised yet. The invincibility frames from other sources, such as bombs or deaths, prevent the first frame of vulnerability from happening. This means the death can only be triggered if the player has no invincibility frames prior to pressing X.
