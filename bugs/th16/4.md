## [what]
[hr_minor]

[hl2]Okina gains a hurtbox during her survival spell-card[/hl2]. With her hurtbox active the player can shoot her and end the spell-card prematurely.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

In HSiFS, Okina can only gain a hurtbox on the survival spell-card through two ways:
1. [hl2]The player's bomb must end during the survival spell-card[/hl2].
2. [hl2]The player's release must end during the survival spell-card[/hl2].


## [why]
[hr_minor]

The code of Okina's boss-fight is located in a file called ``st07bs.ecl``. During the survival spell-card, Okina is given the ``bombShield`` instruction. This instruction is also given during all her other spell-cards.

The ``bombShield`` instruction makes the parent object (in this case, Okina) invincible when a bomb is triggered. Once the bomb or release has ended, the parent object regains its hurtbox.

Since Okina is given a ``bombShield`` instruction on her survival spell-card, it means she regains a hurtbox once the bomb or release has ended. This is exactly what happens and this is what causes Okina to gain a hurtbox during her survival spell-card.
