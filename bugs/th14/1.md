## [what]

Kagerou stops shooting bullets on her second spell, third non-spell and third spell. This effect does not take place in the other stages.

## [how]

The player must repeatedly bomb and/or die on Kagerou's mid-boss spell and/or Kagerou's second spell. This must be done until ``2,000`` bullets have prematurely been cleared.

## [why]

Kagerou's mid-boss spell and second spell both create invisible bullets that spawn after a while. The invisible bullets count towards the bullet cap, which is set at ``2,000``. 

Through bombing and/or dying the bullets are cleared off-screen. This also includes the invisible bullets. However, when clearing the invisible bullets, the game still thinks the bullets are still on-screen because they have never spawned. When repeatedly bombing and/or dying, Kagerou will have spawned ``2,000`` invisible bullets. The bullet cap has reached its maximum so no more bullets can be spawned.
