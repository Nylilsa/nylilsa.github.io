## [what]
[hr_minor]

The float variable ``GAME_SPEED`` determines how fast the game runs. Though, ``GAME_SPEED`` does not simply change the game's FPS - it works through ZUN's ways. The default value of ``GAME_SPEED`` is usually ``1``, but sometimes the variable gets is changed. For example, ``GAME_SPEED`` is changed during the final few seconds of the Shinmyoumaru fight when the player character is slowed down.
During times when ``GAME_SPEED`` is not ``1`` there are some unintentional side effects.[br]
In DDC, such side effects are:
+ Losing power upon death in multiples of ``50``;
+ Gaining power upon death in multiples of ``7``.

The following effects above happen more than once, losing and gaining more power than intended.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

There are a couple of events where the ``GAME_SPEED`` in DDC changes. Those events are listed below:
+ Shinmyoumaru has 0 HP on her final spell card in non-Spell practice (if SakuyaA uses focused knives, ``GAME_SPEED = 1.0``, else ``GAME_SPEED = 0.5``);
+ Shinmyoumaru explodes after her final spell card in non-Spell practice (if SakuyaA uses focused knives, ``GAME_SPEED = 1.0``, else ``GAME_SPEED = 0.25``); 
+ Raiko has 0 HP on her final spell card in non-Spell practice (``GAME_SPEED = 0.5)``;
+ Raiko explodes after her final spell card in non-Spell practice (``GAME_SPEED = 0.25``).

By dying during the slowdown, the effects are executed more than just once.


## [why]
[hr_minor]

Say you were to die on Raiko's final after her final spell card because of a double KO.
The ``GAME_SPEED`` value is programmed to be set to ``0.25``, meaning the game runs ``4`` times slower. The game usually executes the power drop/power loss effects for one frame upon death. However, because the game is ``4`` times slower in this case it means [hl2]that the game executes it ``4`` times instead of the usual ``1`` time[/hl2].

So after the Raiko's final, you will have lost all your power but you have gained 28 small power items in return.
