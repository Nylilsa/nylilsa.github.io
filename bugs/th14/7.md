## [what]

The float variable GAME\_SPEED determines how fast the game runs. Though, GAME\_SPEED does not simply change the game's FPS - it works through ZUN's ways. The default value of GAME\_SPEED is ``1``.
During times when GAME\_SPEED is not ``1`` there are side effects.[br]
In DDC, such side effects are:
+ Losing more power upon death in multiples of ``50``;
+ Gaining more power upon death in multiples of ``7``.

The following effects above happen more than once, losing and gaining more power than intended.

## [how]

The GAME\_SPEED in DDC changes in the following events:
+ Shinmyoumaru has 0 HP on her final spell card in non-Spell practice (if SakuyaA uses focused knives, ``GAME_SPEED = 1.0``, else ``GAME_SPEED = 0.5``);
+ Shinmyoumaru explodes after her final spell card in non-Spell practice (if SakuyaA uses focused knives, ``GAME_SPEED = 1.0``, else ``GAME_SPEED = 0.25``); 
+ Raiko has 0 HP on her final spell card in non-Spell practice (``GAME_SPEED = 0.5)``;
+ Raiko explodes after her final spell card in non-Spell practice (``GAME_SPEED = 0.25``).

By dying during the slowdown, the effects are executed more than just once.


## [why]

Say you were to die on Raiko's final after her final spell card because of a double KO.
Because the GAME\_SPEED value is set to ``0.25`` it means the game runs ``4`` times slower. The game usually executes the power drop/power loss effects for one frame upon death. However, because the game is ``4`` times slower in this case it means that the game executes it ``4`` times instead of the usual ``1`` time.
