## [what]
[hr_minor]

The player can take no damage from bullets, lasers and enemies, allowing invincibility when SakuyaA's barrier is active. 

## [how]
[hr_minor]

In order to replicate the bug, the player must fulfill three criteria:
+ It must be done when SakuyaA's barrier is out;
+ Sakuya must not be in contact with a bullet/laser/enemy during he first frame after the invincibility has worn off;
+ The player must press ``X`` upon initial contact with the bullet/enemy.

The last point means that you have to press and release ``X`` 30 times per second for invincibility until the bomb wears off.
