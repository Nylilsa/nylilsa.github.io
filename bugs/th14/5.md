## [what]

Benben Tsukumo's second spell crashes the game upon finishing the spell.

## [how]

All that is required is for the player to finish/timeout the spell card once all enemies have spawned.
However, the crash does not happen if the player manages to finish the spell before all enemies have spawned, which is only possible through abusing ReimuA and SakuyaA.


## [why_idk]

It is possible that the crash is related to the way the game handles its sprites and animations located in the  ``th14.exe`` file.
