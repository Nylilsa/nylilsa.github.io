## [what]

The game sets your score to a score of 9,999,999,990.

## [how]

The game sets your score to the maximum value because the current score reached a negative value. This is done by capturing a spell that has a negative spell bonus.

## [why]

In order to understand this we must understand how numbers are stored.[br]
Your current score and your highscore is an unsigned 32-bit integer. This means it can store values ranging from ``0`` to ``4,294,967,295``, in total having ``2^32`` possibilities.[br]
In the case of a replay getting a score of ``9,999,999,990``, the value the game reads/writes is ``999,999,999``, **NOT ``9,999,999,990``**. The last digit of the displayed score is saved somewhere else.

### Underflow

Since score can take values from the range ``[0; 4,294,967,295]`` values that go above the limit of ``4,294,967,295`` is called overflow. Values that go below the limit of ``0`` is called underflow.

The integer ``0`` in binary is ``0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000``[sub]2[/sub]. If 1 is subtracted from ``0`` we get a number that in binary is ``1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111``[sub]2[/sub].

As an analogy, just imagine the number ``40,000`` in decimal notation. You are only able to read the first 4 digits from the right (``0000``). If 1 is subtracted from ``40,000`` we get ``39,999``. However, since you are only able to read the first 4 digits from the right the digits you can see are ``9999``. This means subtracting ``1`` from ``0`` sets the score to ``4,294,967,295``.

#### Method

In order to achieve getting a "negative score", the player must use SakuyaA and preferably go in Spell practice for this. 

The way spell bonus is calculated is by subtracting a constant from the current bonus when five seconds have passed. The constant depends on the initial value of the spell bonus.[br]

Take the following example:

SakuyaA is on Spell practice, Lunatic, Wakasagihime's first spell: Tail Fin Slap. The initial value of the spell bonus is ``9,000,000`` and the starting time is ``40.00s``. When 300 frames have passed, the score bonus decreases by a constant of ``2,860`` per frame. Capturing the spell unfocused with ``00.01s`` left would give a total score of ``9,000,000 - 2,860 * 60 * (40 - 5) = 2,994,000`` (The - 5 is because the first 300 frames the score does not decrease). [br]
We want to get a score of 0 or lower, meaning the constant of ``2,860`` has to tick down for at least ``57.45s`` or ``3,447 frames``.

The time of ``57.45s`` is above ``40.00s``, meaning it is not possible to achieve such a high time under normal circumstances. However, SakuyaA's subshot knives allow for special gimmick. The knives slow down the boss's actions as well as the time. This means that a ``40.00s`` long spell can technically be stretched out to a ``58.00s`` attack.[br]
This is done by applying enough knives on the boss, slowing the timer. Once the timer is approaching ``00.00s``, the spell must be capturered last second. If done well, the spell bonus gained should be a negative value. This triggers the underflow.

### 9,999,999,990

There is a scorecap in the modern games of Touhou, which is set at ``9,999,999,990``. This is an arbitrary number chosen by ZUN. It is not possible to get a score higher than ``9,999,999,990`` without the use of modifications.[br]
Essentially, ZUN's dummy code goes as follows:[br]
[code]if (score > 999 999 999) {
    score = 999 999 999; // not 9 999 999 990 because of the 32-bit integer limit
}
[/code]

This is why the score is set to 9,999,999,990 and not anything else.
