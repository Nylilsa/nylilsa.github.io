## [what]
[hr_minor]

Timing out certain attacks of the Tsukumo sisters on Extra sometimes do not end when the timer hits ``0``.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

[hl2]As all characters[/hl2], this can be done by timing out the Tsukumos' 1st and 2nd midspell playing [hl2]from the start of the Extra stage[/hl2]. By doing this, Yatsuhashi leaves the screen and the spellcard ends when the time hits the ``1.97s`` mark. Benben would still be shooting the bullets around, even though the spell has ended. Killing Benben does not do anything interesting.
[hl2]As all characters[/hl2], this can be done by timing out the Tsukumos' 1st and 2nd midspell playing [hl2]from spell practice[/hl2]. By doing this, the spellcard ends when the time hits the ``1.43s`` mark.

However, [hl2]SakuyaA has the ability to slow down enemies[/hl2], including bosses. She can use her knives on one of the bosses. The effects of her are listed below:

[hl2]As SakuyaA[/hl2], this can be done by timing out the Tsukumos' [hl2]midnon[/hl2] playing [hl2]from the start of the Extra stage[/hl2]. SakuyaA has the ability to slow down timers if enough knives are attached to one of the sisters. SakuyaA has the option to either slowdown Benben or to slowdown Yatsuhashi.
+ If Benben is slowed down, then the timer is slowed down as well. When the timer is low enough, Yatsuhashi leaves the screen.
+ If Yatsuhashi is slowed down, then [hl2]the timer is not slowed down[/hl2]. When the timer hits ``0``, Benben leaves the screen. Then, another timer inherited from Yatsuhashi appears.
