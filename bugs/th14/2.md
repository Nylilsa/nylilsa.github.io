## [what]

Marisa's laser(s) bugs out. It may burnout, it may be set at a 45° angle, it may hit an enemy from the opposite end of the screen.

## [how]

Marisa's laser(s) rarely bug out when it comes in contact with an enemy. 

## [why]

The code for Marisa's lasers is as follows:

[code] // For full code, see https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv5915344
\[...\]
if (!a3)
{
    \[...\]
    v19 = v48; // This line causes problems.
    \[...\]
    v20 = v19 + 8,0;
    v7[44] = v20; // Set Length
    \[...\]
}
[/code]

To summarise the code above:[br]
The value of ``v19`` is set to the value of ``v48``.[br]
However, the value of ``v48`` is *undefined*. This is because ``v48`` is an uninitialised variable, meaning ``v48`` has never been assigned a value before. This means ``v48`` has an undefined value.[br]
With this logic, the value of ``v19`` is also undefined.[br]
This also means ``v20`` is undefined.[br]
``v7`` sets the length of Marisa's lasers. Because ``v7`` takes the value of ``v20`` it means that ``v7`` too is undefined.[br]
Because ``v7`` is undefined, the length of Marisa's laser is set to an undefined value. This causes the laser to glitch out.


In terms of why the bug happens very inceconsistently, it has to do with numerous factors; your operating system being one of them from what I have been told.
