## [what]
[hr_minor]

Marisa's laser(s) bugs out. It may burnout, it may be set at a 45Â° angle, it may undergo quantum tunneling and kill and enemy the opposite side of the screen. 

[hl2]This event happens at random[/hl2], meaning your replay may be desynced because of this bug.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

Marisa's laser(s) rarely bug out when it comes in contact with an enemy. This event happens at random. 

## [why]
[hr_minor]

The code for Marisa's lasers is as follows:

[code] // For full code, see https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv5915344
\[...\]
if (!a3)
{
    \[...\]
    v19 = v48; // This line causes problems.
    \[...\]
    v20 = v19 + 8,0;
    v7[44] = v20; // Set Length
    \[...\]
}
[/code]

To summarise the code above:[br]
The value of ``v19`` is set to the value of ``v48``.[br]
However, [hl2]the value of ``v48`` is undefined[/hl2]. This is because ``v48`` [hl2]is an uninitialised variable[/hl2], meaning ``v48`` has never been assigned a value before. This means ``v48`` has an undefined value.[br]
With this logic, the value of ``v19`` is also undefined.[br]
This also means ``v20`` is undefined.[br]
``v7`` sets the length of Marisa's lasers. Because ``v7`` takes the value of ``v20`` it means that ``v7`` too is undefined.[br]
Because ``v7`` is undefined, [hl2]the length of Marisa's laser is set to an undefined value[/hl2]. This causes the laser to glitch out.


In terms of why the bug happens very inconsistently, it has to do with numerous factors; your operating system being one of them from what I have been told.
