## [how]

In order duplicate the gohei it must fulfill the following criteria:
+ Be at a certain range of height based on your power level and the number of frames you will focus;
+ Be far enough from any enemies that the gohei won't home;
+ Setup: starting from an unfocused state, hold shift for 1-8 frames (more details in blog linked below);
+ After releasing shift, go focused again within 12 frames;
+ 12 frames after releasing shift the first time, there is a chance that the gohei will duplicate;
There is some aspect of RNG that affects whether duplication occurs that is not yet understood.
The maximum this duplication can yield is 4 goheis.
