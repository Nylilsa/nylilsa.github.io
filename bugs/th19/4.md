## [what]
[hr_minor]

When fighting Hisami, she likes to spawn lasers. When there are too many lasers at once, the game crashes. This can happen regardless of difficulty.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

The best way to trigger this is to go into VS mode on Lunatic mode, preferably on CPU vs CPU (unless you want to face her yourself). The only requirement is for Hisami to [hl2]cancel a large amount of bullets[/hl2], so the opponent of Hisami does not matter. This ensures that Hisami has the opportunity to cancel a lot of bullets at once spawning the plethora of lasers causing the crash.

It is not sure if this crash can happen on Story mode or on Online VS mode due to a lack of testing.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

The crash happens as a result of the abundance of lasers on-screen. While the sheer number of lasers may not directly cause the crash, each laser is a sprite that runs a script when fired. When a lot of lasers are spawned, a lot of lasers run the script. Although the exact cause is not known, the crash could be caused by the sheer number of scripts currently running.
