## [what]

Entering Practice mode you may see that your player has no bombs.

## [how]

In order to achieve this effect the player must do the following:
1. Launch th18.exe;
2. Go to Practice before the demo replays play;
3. Select any difficulty, any character, any card combination, any stage;
4. Enter the stage.

It is important to note that this only works once upon booting up the game. When resetting the stage the bomb count is set to ``3``. The player must avoid going to "Game Start", "Exta Start", "Spell Practice" and "Replay". Once any stage is loaded this does not work anymore.
