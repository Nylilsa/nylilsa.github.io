## [what]
[hr_minor]

The float variable GAME\_SPEED determines how fast the game runs. Though, GAME\_SPEED does not simply change the game's FPS - it works through ZUN's ways. The default value of GAME\_SPEED is ``1``.
During times when GAME\_SPEED is not ``1`` there are side effects.[br]
In UM, such side effects are:
+ Losing more power upon death in multiples of ``100``;
+ Losing more power upon death in multiples of ``50`` (with the Pebble Hat card);
+ Gaining more power upon death in multiples of ``7``;
+ Gaining more bombs upon death in multiples of ``1`` (with the Princess Kaguya's Secret Stach card).

The following effects above happen more than once, losing and gaining more power than intended.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

The GAME\_SPEED in UM changes in the following event:
+ Momoyo explodes after her final spell card in non-Spell practice (``GAME_SPEED = 0.25``).

By dying during the slowdown, the effects are executed more than just once.


## [why]
[hr_minor]

Say the GAME\_SPEED value is set to ``0.25``. This means the game runs ``4`` times slower. The game usually executes the power drop/power loss effects for one frame upon death. However, because the game is ``4`` times slower in this case it means that the game executes it ``4`` times instead of the usual ``1`` time.
