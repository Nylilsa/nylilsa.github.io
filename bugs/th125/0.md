## [specs]

* **Versions**: [yes]1.00a[/yes]
* **Shottype**: [yes]Aya[/yes] - [yes]Hatate[/yes]
* **Scenes**: 12-6

## [what]
[hr_minor]

On scene 12-6, you will sometimes be killed instantly despite the bullets not being near you. This happens at random, including during the replay.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

Play scene 12-6.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

The code of the attack is scored in the ``ecl25_c.ecl`` file. The [hl2]full[/hl2] code for the attack goes as follows:

[code]void Boss1_at1_at() {
    var A, B, C, D, E;
    flagSet(291);
    setHurtbox(8.0f, 48.0f);
    setHitbox(8.0f, 48.0f);
    %C = %F2;
    %D = %F3;
    moveVel(%C + (0.17453292f * %D), 4.0f);
    moveVelTime(30, 0, %C - (0.17453292f * %D), 8.0f);
    wait(30);
    etNew(0);
    etSprite(0, 0, 2);
    etAngle(0, 1.5707964f + (0.34906584f * %D), 1.5707964f + (0.34906584f * %D));
    etSpeed(0, 2.0f, 2.0f);
    laserNew(0, -1.0f, -1.0f, -1.0f, 16.0f);

    etEx(0, 0, 0, 1024, 120, 0, -999999.0f, -999999.0f);

    etEx(0, 0, 0, 4096, 60, -999999, -999999.0f, -999999.0f);
    $E = 4 + $DS1;
    goto Boss1_at1_at_2132 @ 0;
Boss1_at1_at_1944:
    etEx(0, 1, 0, 4, 60, -999999, (%RANDF * 0.02f) + 0.02f, -999.0f);
    etAngle(0, %RANDRAD, 0.0f);
    etOn(0);
Boss1_at1_at_2132:

    delete();
}[/code]


The first line ``var A, B, C, D, E;`` declares the variables ``A``, ``B``, ``C``, ``D``, and ``E``. The variables aren't too useful in this stage - [hl2]the variables need to be initialised first[/hl2] before usage, which is done by assigning the variables a value. All variables are assigned a value before they are read, [hl2]except for variables ``A`` and ``B``[/hl2]. Its value is read in the line ``etOffsetAbs(0, %A, %B)``, but ``A`` and ``B`` are not assigned a value prior to this. This means that ``A`` and ``B`` are [hl2]uninitialised variables[/hl2]. The uninitialised variables ``A`` and ``B`` will have *some* value, but its value is [hl2]not predictable[/hl2]. 

Because of the unpredictable value of the uninitialised variables ``A`` and ``B``, this can result in serious side effects such as instantly killing the player.

### More detailed explanation
[hr_minor]

The position of the blue bullets are initialised using the value of field B of some object A. This object A itself is initialized with the code at addresses ``0x410240-0x410482``, but field B is uninitialized. Therefore, [hl2]the memory content originally in object A's region is used as the value of field B[/hl2].

Object A is allocated from the heap area, but this area is not necessarily cleared to 0 and may be dirty with old data. This means that field B is dirty with old data, and the position of the blue bullet is also dirty.

The way field B is set may change with each game play or replay. Therefore, the following phenomena occur:
+ The location of the blue bullets changes each time you play the game or replay.
+ The random number changes due to the change in the position where the blue bullet is generated, and as a result other elements such as the laser also change.

Any replay of 12-6 suffices, so none are provided.
