## [what] 

The boss's initial position in spell practice does not match the boss's position outside of spell practice. This happens to the following spell cards:

1. Yuyuko's second spell card (5, 6, 7, 8); ``(32 units higher in spell practice)``
2. Yuyuko's third spell card (9, 10, 11, 12); ``(32 units higher in spell practice)``
3. Seiga's first spell card (48, 49, 50, 51); ``(32 units higher in spell practice)``
4. Futo's second spell card (67, 68, 69 ,70); ``(16 units higher in spell practice)``
5. Miko's fifth spell card (95, 96, 97, 98); ``(16 units lower in spell practice)``
6. Miko's sixth spell card (99, 100, 101, 102); ``(16 units lower in spell practice) ``
7. Miko's seventh spell card (103, 104, 105, 106). ``(56 units higher in spell practice)``

The numbers in brackets represent the spell IDs.

## [how]

The boss skips over some instructions it would otherwise do outside of spell practice. The boss may therefore not move or have a wrong movement limit.

## [why]

The reason varies from spell to spell.

### 1. Yuyuko's second spell card (5, 6, 7, 8);
In spell practice, Yuyuko has a y-range of ``[96, 160]``. She is programmed to move to ``y = 192``. ``y = 192`` is outside the range of ``[96, 160]`` so she can only move to ``y = 160``.[br]
Outside spell practice, Yuyuko has a y-range of ``[32, 224]`` She is programmed to move to ``y = 192``. ``y = 192`` is inside the range of ``[32, 224]`` so she moves to ``y = 192``.
### 2. Yuyuko's third spell card (9, 10, 11, 12);
In spell practice, Yuyuko has a y-range of ``[96, 160]``. She is programmed to move to ``y = 192``. ``y = 192`` is outside the range of ``[96, 160]`` so she can only move to ``y = 160``.[br]
Outside spell practice, Yuyuko has a y-range of ``[32, 224]`` She is programmed to move to ``y = 192``. ``y = 192`` is inside the range of ``[32, 224]`` so she moves to ``y = 192``.
### 3. Seiga's first spell card (48, 49, 50, 51);
In spell practice, Seiga has a y-range of ``[96, 160]``. She is programmed to move to ``y = 96``. ``y = 96`` is inside the range of ``[96, 160]`` so she moves to ``y = 96``.[br]
Outside spell practice, Seiga has a y-range of ``[128, 192]`` She is programmed to move to ``y = 96``. ``y = 96`` is outside the range of ``[128, 192]`` so she can only move to ``y = 128``.
### 4. Futo's second spell card (67, 68, 69 ,70);
In spell practice, Futo has a y-range of ``[96, 160]``. She is programmed to move to ``y = 96``. ``y = 96`` is inside the range of ``[96, 160]`` so she moves to ``y = 96``.[br]
Outside spell practice, Futo has a y-range of ``[112, 144]`` She is programmed to move to ``y = 96``. ``y = 96`` is outside the range of ``[112, 144]`` so she can only move to ``y = 112``.
### 5. Miko's fifth spell card (95, 96, 97, 98);
In spell practice, Miko moves to ``y = 144``. An instruction that tells her to move to ``y = 128`` is skipped.[br]
Outside spell practice, Miko goes to ``y = 128``.
### 6. Miko's sixth spell card (99, 100, 101, 102);
In spell practice, Miko moves to ``y = 144``. An instruction that tells her to move to ``y = 128`` is skipped.[br]
Outside spell practice, Miko goes to ``y = 128``.
### 7. Miko's seventh spell card (103, 104, 105, 106).
In spell practice, Miko moves to ``y = 144``. An instruction that tells her to move to ``y = 200`` is skipped.[br]
Outside spell practice, Miko goes to ``y = 200``.
