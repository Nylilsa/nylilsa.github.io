## [what]
[hr_minor]

last spell can be triggered despite not meeting the required time.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

This mostly happens accidentally and rarely. There must be a lot of bullets on-screen right before last spell is triggered and player must be right below time threshold 

## [why]
[hr_minor]

Game doesn't look at time you have.
Game looks at time you have + bullets on-screen.
Bullet on-screen would be cancelled and turned into time.
If sum >= requirement, then LS is triggered.
However, some bullets are almost off-screen. Those bullets will then turn into time. That time is too far off-screen so player doesn't pick it up.
This means it's possible for time to be below requirement.
