## [what]
[hr_minor]

When watching a replay from Stage 2 through Stage 6, the replay may desynchronise in the middle of the stage.  

## [how]
[hr_minor]

Based on my observations, it goes as follows:

1. Start a replay on Stage 2 through Stage 6.
2. Wait for the replay to have timed out a hyper.
3. If unlucky, the tokens dropped from the hyper are different from what was originally dropped.

Once different tokens spawns, those tokens causes for different RNG to take place which inevitably causes the replay to desync.
