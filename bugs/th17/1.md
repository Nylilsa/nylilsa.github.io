## [what] 
[hr_minor]

It is possible to instantly deactivate a hyper after picking up the 5th, giving the player 2 or 5 tokens in return after the text "Extra Beasts Appear !" shows up.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

This is done by picking up the 5th token 8 frames after getting hit by a bullet/enemy.


## [why]
[hr_minor]

If token gets picked up during [0,7], then the hyper gets broken and nothing happens.
If token gets picked up during [9, inf) before dying, then the hyper gets activated
If token gets picked up at 8, then this happens.

Game gets confused about player state. This results in weird stuff so bla bla bla
