## [what]
[hr_minor]

[hl2]The player instantly dies whilst breaking their hyper[/hl2]. It is not possible to escape the death through death-bombing. 

## [how]
[hr_minor]

The moment the player is hit whilst manually breaking the hyper kills the player.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

During the first frame of the intentional hyper break [hl2]the invincibility frames of the hyper break haven't initialised yet[/hl2].  As mentioned before, it is not possible to escape this death through death-bombing. When the hyper is broken, there is a slight cooldown in which the player cannot bomb. This cooldown prevents the player from escaping the death through the means of death-bombing. 
Though, the invincibility frames from other sources, such as bombs or deaths, prevent the first frame of vulnerability from happening. This means the death can only be triggered if the player has no invincibility frames prior to pressing [key=X].
