## [what]
[hr_minor]

ReimuA does not produce any sound when shooting when at a certain power treshold.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

[hl2]ReimuA's power[/hl2] must be [hl2]between 16 and 31 power[/hl2] for her to not generate any sound while shooting.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

When the player reaches a certain power treshold, the game assigns pre-loaded shooter options to the player. For example, when ReimuA is between 0 and 7 power, she only has her default shot. When she reaches 8 power, she has her default shot plus two homing amulets: she has gained two [hl2]player bullets[/hl2].

In EoSD, every player bullet comes with its set of properties. One of its properties is its ``bulletSoundId``. The sound corresponding to its ``bulletSoundId`` is played continuously when the player fires its shot. 

When ReimuA reaches the 16 power treshold (power is between 16 and 31 inclusive), every one of its four player bullets has a ``bulletSoundId`` of ``NO_SOUND``, meaning that for every player bullet, [hl2]no sound is played when a bullet is shot[/hl2]. This is the only occurence in this game when a player shooting produces no sound, meaning this mistake is likely due to a typo.
