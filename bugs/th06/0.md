## [what]
[hr_minor]

The player must trigger this glitch on a non-spell for it to have any effect. Usually, the subsequent spell is skipped but in few cases two spells are skipped. 

## [how]
[hr_minor]

The player must end the non-spell during the last frame of the non-spell, meaning it is a frame-perfect skip.
