## [what]
[hr_minor]

The player must trigger this glitch on a non-spell for it to have any effect. This glitch can be done on all non-spells. Usually, the subsequent spell is skipped but in few cases something special happens.

If done on Cirno's second non-spell, all her subsequent spells are skipped and the fight ends.
If done on Meiling's third non-spell, all her subsequent spells are skipped and the fight ends.
If done on Remilia's fourth non-spell, the subsequent spell is skipped, but the final spell-card is not skipped. Instead, the player faces the final spell-card "Red Magic", regardless of difficulty. This means it is possible to face Red Magic on Hard and Lunatic mode.


## [how]
[hr_minor]

The player must end the non-spell exactly during the last frame of the non-spell, meaning it is a frame-perfect skip. 

## [why]
[hr_minor]

I don't know.
