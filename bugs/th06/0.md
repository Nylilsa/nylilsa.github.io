## [what]
[hr_minor]

The player must trigger this glitch on a non-spell for it to have any effect. This glitch can be done on all non-spells as well as some spells. Usually, the subsequent spell is skipped but in few cases something special happens.

If done on Cirno's second non-spell, all her subsequent spells are skipped and the fight ends.
If done on Meiling's third non-spell, all her subsequent spells are skipped and the fight ends.
If done on Remilia's fourth non-spell, the subsequent spell is skipped, but the final spell-card is not skipped. Instead, the player faces the final spell-card "Red Magic", regardless of difficulty. This means it is possible to face Red Magic on Hard and Lunatic mode.

Also, it is possible to do the skip on Meiling's third spell and Cirno's second spell.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

The player must end the non-spell exactly during the last frame of the non-spell, meaning it is a frame-perfect skip. 

## [why]
[hr_minor]

Probably because of the following:
An attack is skipped if at least one of the following two conditions hold:
1. The attack reaches a certain amount of HP that is greater than 0.
2. The attack is timed out.

When doing the skip, both conditions are held. The game probably does the skip for the first time because condition 1 is met, then the game skips for the second time because condition 2 is met. The skip is done twice so two attacks are skipped.
