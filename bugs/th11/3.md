## [what]
[hr_minor]

Rarely, a replay using ReimuC desyncs. This only happens in stages 2 through 6.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

When the desync happens, [hl2]ReimuC is always moving immediately before the stage transition[/hl2]. In particular, ReimuC is moving with her [hl2]fast unfocused speed[/hl2].

When wanting to move around really quickly as ReimuC, the player must do the following:
1. ReimuC must not shoot.
2. ReimuC must not be focused.
3. ReimuC must be moving.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

For ReimuC to move quickly while unfocused, [hl2]ReimuC must already be moving prior[/hl2] for a few frames. In other words, [hl2]the game must detect that ReimuC is already moving[/hl2] before ReimuC can move with her fast unfocused speed.

When loading a replay from stage 2 through stage 6, [hl2]the game does not detect that ReimuC was moving prior[/hl2]. This is opposite of when the stage was loaded by replaying the previous stage, in which case the game does detect that ReimuC is already moving.
