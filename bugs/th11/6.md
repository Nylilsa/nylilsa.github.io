## [what]
[hr_minor]

Replays on Stage 6 desync.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

For the desync to happen, the player must do one of the following:
+ Start the replay from Stage 5. Right when the stage is about to end, fast-forward by using [key=Ctrl].
+ Start the replay from Stage 6.

The desync [hl2]always[/hl2] happens on Utsuho, usually during her first non-spell or first spell-card. The desync in both cases is differently.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

The desync is caused because there is a [hl2]desync in the RNG[/hl2]. A desync in the RNG means that the RNG value is different than what it is supposed to be. This means that after an RNG desync, if the RNG value is called for, the game desyncs.

There are two different desyncs: one starting from Stage 5 and where the game is fast-forwarded during the stage transition, and one starting from Stage 6. The two desyncs seem different but they are related.

I will distinguish three different methods that result in a different Stage 6 playback:
1. The Stage 5 Fast-Forward methods (abbreviated to ``S5-FF``). This methods desyncs the replay.
2. The Stage 5 No-Fast-Forward methods (abbreviated to ``S5-NFF``). This methods does [hl2]not[/hl2] desync the replay.
3. The Stage 6 methods (abbreviated to ``S6``). This methods desyncs the replay.

### RNG difference
[hr_minor]

From replay analysis, we can take a look at the number of RNG calls the replay makes.

We take an arbitrary replay and watch Stage 6 with the ``S5-NFF`` method. Then, we look at its number of RNG calls during the 7200th frame of Stage 6, which is always during Utsuho's dialogue. Suppose that the ``S5-NFF`` method yields ``n`` number of RNG calls.
Using the same replay, we watch Stage 6 with the ``S5-FF`` method. Its number of RNG calls is equal to ``n-5``.
Using the same replay, we watch Stage 6 with the ``S6`` method. Its number of RNG calls is equal to ``n+1``.

This means that relative to the non-desynced ``S5-NFF`` method, the ``S5-FF`` method makes [hl2]5 RNG calls too few[/hl2], and that the ``S6`` method makes [hl2]1 RNG call too much[/hl2]. If too many or too few RNG calls are made relative to ``S5-NFF`` method, then it means that anything that the RNG value is different and therefore anything that uses the RNG value does it so wrongly.

### Desync cause
[hr_minor]

Upon analysis, it turns out the [hl2]stage background is loaded at a different time[/hl2] depending on how the stage is entered from. The stage background in question is the file ``stage06.std``.

When entering Stage 6 with the ``S5-FF`` method, the stage background is loaded 5f later than with the ``S5-NFF`` method.
When entering Stage 6 with the ``S6`` method, the stage background is loaded 1f earlier than with the ``S5-NFF`` method.

In the file ``stage06.std``, data about the Stage 6 background is noted. In it, there is an instruction that applies some stage background effects which will be called ``distortion``, (thanks ExpHP for [a=https://exphp.github.io/thpages/#/std/ins?g=11]documentation[/a]).
In particular, ``distortion(2)`` is the instruction that [hl2]calls for RNG once every frame[/hl2] (note: no other stages use this instruction hence it not happening on other stages). This instruction is only used right when the stage's background switches to the sun right before Utsuho spawns, meaning the desync only happens on Utsuho.

In terms of why the stage background is loaded differently depending on how it is viewed, I do not know. Ask ZUN.

### Conclusion
[hr_minor]

[box=1000]Replays desync at Utsuho's if the replay is [hl2]started from Stage 6[/hl2] or if the replay is [hl2]started from Stage 5 and fast-forwarding is done[/hl2] in between stage 5 being cleared and stage 6 starting. This has to do with the [hl2]RNG being different[/hl2]. The RNG difference is caused by [hl2]code used by the stage background[/hl2]. The RNG difference exists because the [hl2]stage background is loaded at a wrong time[/hl2] during the desync.[/box]

Any replay that reaches Utsuho suffices, so none are provided.
