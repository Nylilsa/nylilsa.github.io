## [what]
[hr_minor]

The replay desyncs when starting from the stage prior to the desync. Sometimes, it is also possible for the replay to desync even when playing the replay from the start of the stage, resulting in a replay that cannot be watched unless a third party tool is used.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

Bomb before stage transition happens. The effect may be different depending on the character used and when the bomb was used.
Furthermore, you must have 2.00 power or more for the desync to work when exiting the stage.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

Replay data is stored at the [hl2]end of the stage transition[/hl2].
But some replay data, such as score, power, piv are [hl2]loaded[/hl2] at the [hl2]beginning[/hl2] of the stage transition. (Note that the player position is loaded at the end of the stage transition.)

Before the stage transition bomb is used, the player automatically loses 1.00 power. Then, the player bombs, losing another 1.00 power. The player then enters the stage with 1.00 power less. (Note: It is possible to lose 2.00 power or more by bombing multiple times during the stage transition.)

Furthermore, if the player uses a long-lasting bomb, it is possible to carry over the bomb to the next stage in which the bomb would interact with an enemy, possibly killing it. When rewatching the replay by directly starting from the stage, the bomb would not be there, meaning that the previously killed enemy would now live on. This desync makes the stage unwatchable regardless from the stage it was started on.
