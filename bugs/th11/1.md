## [what]
[hr_minor]

2-power ReimuA deals very little damage more compared to 1-power ReimuA.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

This is done by playing as the character ReimuA and being between 2.00-2.95 power. This affects both the focused and unfocused shot of ReimuA.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

This information was extracted from the ``pl00a.sht`` file, which contains most shottype data about ReimuA. Below is denoted some information about the damage of 1-power ReimuA and 2-power ReimuA.

+ ``Shooter`` displays information about what type of bullet ReimuA shoots.
+ ``Damage`` gives information about how much damage per shot one bullet deals
+ ``Shot per second`` gives information about how many shots per second are fired, assuming the player continuously holds [key=Z] to shoot.

Given this information, we can calculate the DPS (Damage per Second) for each power threshold.

### Damage information of [hl2]1-power ReimuA[/hl2]
[hr_minor]

|   Shooter    | Damage | Shot per second |
|--------------|--------|-----------------|
| Left Amulet  | 15     | 20              |
| Right Amulet | 15     | 20              |
|   Needle 1   | 7      | 20              |
|   Needle 2   | 7      | 20              |

[br]

DPS:  ``20 * (15 + 15 + 7 + 7) = 20 * 44 = 880`` damage per second.

### Damage information of [hl2]2-power ReimuA[/hl2]
[hr_minor]

|   Shooter    |   Damage   | Shot per second |
|:-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Left Amulet  | 14         | 20              |
| Right Amulet | 14         | 20              |
|   Needle 1   | 5          | 20              |
|   Needle 2   | 6          | 20              |
|   Needle 3   | 6          | 20              |
|   Needle 4   |[hl1]0[/hl1]| 20              |

[br]

It can be seen that [hl2]one of the needles of 2-power ReimuA deals ``0`` damage[/hl2].
DPS: ``20 * (14 + 14 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 0) = 20 * 45 = 900`` damage per second.

### DPS of ReimuA across all power levels
[hr_minor]

To avoid redundancy, the damage values of 0-power, 3-power and 4-power ReimuA are not displayed in a table in this section. Instead, their DPS has been calculated.
+ 0-power ReimuA DPS: ``20 * (16 + 16) = 20 * 32 = 640`` damage per second.
+ 1-power ReimuA DPS: ``20 * (15 + 15 + 7 + 7) = 20 * 44 = 880`` damage per second.
+ 2-power ReimuA DPS: ``20 * (14 + 14 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 0) = 20 * 45 = 900`` damage per second.
+ 3-power ReimuA DPS: ``20 * (14 + 14 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5) = 20 * 58 = 1160`` damage per second.
+ 4-power ReimuA DPS: ``20 * (14 + 14 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 4) = 20 * 64 = 1280`` damage per second.

The information is summarised in the following table:

|  Power level   | DPS (Damage per Second) | Percentage increase |
|:--------------:|-------------------------|---------------------|
| 0-power |           640           |         -           |
| 1-power |           880           |         37.5%       |
| 2-power |           900           |         2.3%        |
| 3-power |           1160          |         28.9%       |
| 4-power |           1280          |         10.3%       |

[br]

The 2-power ReimuA bug is most likely caused because [hl2]ZUN made a typo[/hl2] resulting in one of 2-power ReimuA's needles to deal ``0`` damage. Presumably, [hl2]the needle that deals 0 damage is supposed to deal 5 damage.[/hl2]
