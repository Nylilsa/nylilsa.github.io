## [what]
[hr_minor]

It is possible to skip the mid-bosses Rin and Sanae in Stage 6 and Extra stage respectively.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

It is not possible to shoot or bomb during the dialogue. Though, it is possible to [hl2]bomb before the dialogue[/hl2] starts. The skip is done by bombing right before the dialogue starts, dealing damage to the boss. This can only be done with characters that have a strong enough bomb that can deplete the mid-boss's HP.

In Stage 6, the mid-boss Rin can be skipped by ReimuC, MarisaA and MarisaB.
In the Extra stage, the mid-boss Sanae can be skipped by ReimuC and MarisaB.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

When the mid-bosses Rin ans Sanae spawn, [hl2]the mid-bosses do not have invincibility[/hl2], meaning boss can take damage.

Usually when facing a mid-boss, the mid-boss is programmed to go to their spell-card attack when their HP is depleted enough. However, these checks are not initialised yet when the boss appears - only when the dialogue has ended will be mid-boss use her attacks and set her spell-cards.

By using a well-timed bomb, the mid-boss is able to take damage during dialogue and thus the mid-boss can be killed thus skipped.
