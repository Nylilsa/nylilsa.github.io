## [what] 

Upon successfully replicating the Sagume Skip, her fight ends immediately and you are brought to her post-boss dialogue. Upon doing this you will not trigger the spells, meaning if you never faced any spells before they will appear as ??? when looking at your Player Data. Also, you will be missing out on free chapter bonuses. The game runs normally after skipping Sagume.
## [how]

The player must deal over a specific amount of damage in three frames on any of her non-spells. If any damage is dealt between the transition of her non-spell and spell the spell will start off with reduced HP. If enough damage is dealt between the transition of her non-spell and spell her HP will be below 0, causing the spell not to be triggered and instantly skipping the fight.

This is generally achieved by doing a precise bomb right before her spell gets triggered. The bombs ensure that the yin-yangs are destroyed, depleting Sagume's HP thus skipping the fight.

Because a powerfull bomb is recommended shottypes like Marisa and Reisen are not suitable for replicating the skip. Although it is theoretically possible, their bombs and shot are not suited for this job.

## [why]

The player has a three frame window to deplete Sagume's spell HP. The spell HP goes as follows:
* Spell 1: 2300 HP
* Spell 2: 3100 HP
* Spell 3: 2500 HP

The player can only deal 60 HP of damage to an enemy per frame, meaning only `3 * 60 = 180` HP can be deducted purely from player damage.
The rest of the damage comes from destroying the yin yangs. The yin yangs vary from non-spell to non-spell, each of them recuding their own number of HP when destroyed. The values go as follows:

* Yin yangs on non-spell 1: -220 HP
* Yin yangs on non-spell 2: -330 HP
* Yin yangs on non-spell 3: -330 HP

(Although the non-spells have a mix of red and blue yin yangs, they both deal the same damage when destroyed.)

All non-spells have a total of 12 yin yangs per wave on all difficulties. The only instances in which this does not apply is the second non-spell and the third non-spell on Easy mode as it only has 6 yin yangs per wave.

Suppose all yin yangs are killed and the boss is being hit by the player, the following would be the maximum damage possible in the three frames:
* Non-spell 1: `3 * 60 + 220 * 12 = 2820` HP, dealing `520` excess damage.
* Non-spell 2: `3 * 60 + 330 * 12 = 4140` HP, dealing `1040` excess damage.
* Non-spell 3: `3 * 60 + 330 * 12 = 4140` HP, dealing `1640` excess damage.

On non-spell 1, the player must kill at least 10 / 12 yin yangs to execute the skip.[br]
On non-spell 2, the player must kill at least 9 / 12 yin yangs to execute the skip.[br]
On non-spell 3, the player must kill at least 8 / 12 yin yangs to execute the skip.

Since there is too much precision involved when destroying the yin yangs, it is therefore much easier to execute the skip on the third non-spell as opposed to the second or the first. 

The reason why there is a three frame window between the non-spell and the spell has to do with the mode Point Device. It is not uncommon to die the frame the chapter ends. In order to prevent an eternal softlock between the transition the game needs a few frames of waiting between chapters.
