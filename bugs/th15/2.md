## [what]
[hr_minor]

The uneven wave of Doremy's first non-spell on Lunatic spins faster than intended. The pattern looks very messy and it looks like there is little to no consistency to it.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

This can be seen by facing Doremy Sweet on her first non-spell on Lunatic mode.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

There is a variable in the code that determines the angular velocity of the bullets Doremy shoots on her first non-spell.

This this the angular velocity on the [hl2]uneven waves[/hl2] of Doremy's opener:

| Difficulty | Angular velocity |
|:----------:|:----------------:|
|    Easy    |     -0.034907    |
|   Normal   |     -0.022689    |
|    Hard    |     -0.017453    |
|   Lunatic  |     -0.017453    |

This this the angular velocity on the [hl2]even waves[/hl2] of Doremy's opener:

| Difficulty | Angular velocity |
|:----------:|:----------------:|
|    Easy    |     0.034907     |
|   Normal   |     0.022689     |
|    Hard    |     0.017453     |
|   Lunatic  |     [hl1]0.174533[/hl1]     |


The angular velocity of Doremy's first non-spell on Lunatic is `0.174533`, which is about nine times faster than its angular velocity on Hard mode. This is the reason why Doremy's first non-spell on the even waves feels off.

+ Any Lunatic replay of Stage 3 suffices, so none are provided for now.

Soon.
