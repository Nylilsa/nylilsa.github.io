## [what]
[hr_minor]

Very rarely, when starting a replay from either Stage 3, Stage 4, Stage 5 or Stage 6, the replay desyncs. This only happens with Reisen.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

This event happens conditionally, meaning this can be replicated consistently. The steps to replicate the desync are as follows:
1. Play as Reisen on Legacy mod.
2. On Stage 2/3/4/5, exit the stage with at least 1 shield
3. On the next stage (Stage 3/4/5/6), make sure to not use a bomb. Though, you may die.
4. Survive until the player is able to graze some lasers. 
The replay should desynchronise when starting the replay from the stage in which the steps were performed on.
