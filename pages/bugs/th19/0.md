## [what]
[hr_minor]

It is possible to be sent back to Stage 2 while playing on Story mode regardless of difficulty and character. You will keep all of your cards and the game progresses as normal. This also happens when you beat the last boss of Story mode, in which case you will obtain a card and be sent to Stage 2. This glitch can be repeated many times until the game crashes, presumably because of having too many cards. This glitch was patches in version 1.10c as ZUN made it not possible to draw in story mode anymore.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

This is caused by getting a draw on a boss, then beating the boss. The game sends you to Stage 2. This process can be repeated.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

It is unknown why the player is sent back to Stage 2.
