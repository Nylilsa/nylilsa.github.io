## [what] 
[hr_minor]

On Momoyo's 6th spell-card, yellow bullets are supposed to spawn at the end of the lasers. However, in this bug they spawn between the lasers i.e. at the wrong position.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

This can be done by facing Momoyo's 6th spell-card. This only happens occasionally.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

This is due to an uninitialized variable in a field related to a hardcoded function that this spell-card uses.
