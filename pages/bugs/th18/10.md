## [what] 
[hr_minor]

On Momoyo's 6th spell-card, yellow bullets are supposed to spawn at the end of the lasers. However, in this bug they spawn between the lasers i.e. at the wrong position.

[img=bugs/th18/10_laser.png, figtitle=The end of the lasers do not spawn bullets. Instead, this behaviour happens between the lasers., alt=Momoyo's 5th spell-card being bugged, spawning bullets where there are not supposed to be any bullets.]

## [how]
[hr_minor]

This can be done by facing Momoyo's 6th spell-card. This only happens very rarely.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

This is due to an [hl2]uninitialized variable[/hl2] in a field related to a hardcoded function that this spell-card uses. More detail will be provided in the future.

### [rpy]
[hr_minor]

Due to the nature of this bug of it revolving around an [hl2]uninitialized variable[/hl2], it is not possible to get a consistent replay for it.
