## [what]
[hr_minor]

Momoyo's 8th spell-card is a spell-card that is aimed at the player and spawns a cluster of bullets that fire at a random direction from where the player was previously at. There is a bug in which [hl2]Momoyo continues to spawn a cluster of bullets that are never-ending[/hl2]. This phenomenon appears at around the ~20.00 second mark. Momoyo continues to attack the player as she normally does, meaning that the amount of clusters of bullets increases. She continues firing new waves until the spell ends.

[img=bugs/th18/7_spam.png, figtitle=Marisa is being overwhelmed by Momoyo's attack Dragon Eater., alt=Momoyo overwhelming the player with bullets] [br]

## [how]
[hr_minor]

There are two requirements to be met for this bug to be triggered:
1. The player must time down Momoyo's 8th spell-card for at least 60 seconds.
2. The player must **NOT** be at an incredibly precise angle relative to Momoyo. The reason for this is explained in the next paragraph.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

The information provided in this section is obtained by decompiling the ``st07bs.ecl`` file through using ``thecl`` with a premade eclmap. In the following section, all instruction names will be explained. Furthermore, if you want to read more about what the instructions do, you can search it up in [a=https://priw8.github.io/#s=modding/ins&table=18]the following page[/a].

### Momoyo's subroutines
[hr_minor]

Momoyo's 8th spell-card uses several [hl2]subroutines[/hl2] to do her attacks. A subroutine is a set of instructions designed to perform a frequently used operation within a program. The following relevant subroutines to Momoyo's 8th spell-card are as follows:

[code]void BossCard8() {
    [...]
    floatTime(0, %F1, 3600, 0, 3.0f, 30.0f);
    loop {
        $I1 = _S(%F1);
        @BossCard8_at();
    }
}[/code]

[code]void BossCard8_at() {
    var ANGLE;
    [...]
    %ANGLE = %ANGLE_PLAYER - 3.1415927f;
    circlePos(%F0, %F1, %ANGLE + 1.0471976f, 1400.0f);
    enmCreate("BossCard8_et", 0.0f, 0.0f, 100, 0, 0);
    circlePos(%F0, %F1, %ANGLE + 0.5235988f, 1400.0f);
    enmCreate("BossCard8_et", 0.0f, 0.0f, 100, 0, 0);
    circlePos(%F0, %F1, %ANGLE, 1400.0f);
    enmCreate("BossCard8_et", 0.0f, 0.0f, 100, 0, 0);
    circlePos(%F0, %F1, %ANGLE - 0.5235988f, 1400.0f);
    enmCreate("BossCard8_et", 0.0f, 0.0f, 100, 0, 0);
    circlePos(%F0, %F1, %ANGLE - 1.0471976f, 1400.0f);
    enmCreate("BossCard8_et", 0.0f, 0.0f, 100, 0, 0);
    return;
}[/code]

[code]void BossCard8_et() {
    var DECREMENT;
    [...]
    $DECREMENT = $I1;
BossCard8_et_1040:
    etAngle(1, %A, 0.0f);
    %A = %A + 3.883222f;
    validRad(%A);
    etDist(1, %RANDF2 * _f(32));
    etOn(1);
    wait(3);
BossCard8_et_1284:
    if ($DECREMENT--) goto BossCard8_et_1040 @ 0;
    delete();
}
[/code]

All the aforementioned code is explained in the following section. Also, [hl2]the important instructions will be highlighted[/hl2] !

### Code Explanation
[hr_minor]

+ ``BossCard8`` is what Momoyo is currently. 
+ ``BossCard8_at`` is what Momoyo attacks with. In this case, it only spawns an enemy called ``BossCard8_et``.
+ ``BossCard8_et`` is the invisible enemy that is spawned by ``BossCard8_at``. ``BossCard8_et`` is the one that spawns bullets. ``BossCard8_et`` despawns after a certain time.

In short, Momoyo uses the code at ``BossCard8`` to spawn invisible enemies called ``BossCard8_et`` that shoot the bullets ``BossCard8_at``.

#### BossCard8
[hr_minor]

For convenience, the code is posted below again:

[code]void BossCard8() {
    [...]
    floatTime(0, %F1, 3600, 0, 3.0f, 30.0f);
    loop {
        $I1 = _S(%F1);
        @BossCard8_at();
    }
}[/code]



The instruction [ins=0, n=91] does the following:
In ``time`` frames using ``mode`` [a=https://exphp.github.io/thpages/#/anm/interpolation]mode[/a], variable ``var`` changes from ``start`` to ``final``.
[hl2]Instruction ``[ins=0, n=91](0, %[ins=1, n=-9980], 3600, 0, 3.0f, 30.0f)`` does the following[/hl2]: The float variable [ins=1, n=-9980] is defined and updated every frame for ``3600`` frames long. Its initial value is 3.0 and its final value is 30.0. This takes a total of ``3600`` frames and it is done linearly (so on frame ``t`` the variable [ins=1, n=-9980] is equal to ``27/3600*t+3``).

The line ``$[ins=1, n=-9984] = _S(%[ins=1, n=-9980])`` declares the integer variable [ins=1, n=-9984], which is equal to the float value of [ins=1, n=-9980] but converted to an integer and rounded down. This action is looped.

The line ``@BossCard8_at()`` calls for the subroutine ``BossCard8_at``. This action is looped.

#### BossCard8_at
[hr_minor]

For convenience, the code is posted below again:

[code]void BossCard8_at() {
    var ANGLE;
    [...]
    %ANGLE = %ANGLE_PLAYER - 3.1415927f;
    circlePos(%F0, %F1, %ANGLE + 1.0471976f, 1400.0f);
    enmCreate("BossCard8_et", 0.0f, 0.0f, 100, 0, 0);
    circlePos(%F0, %F1, %ANGLE + 0.5235988f, 1400.0f);
    enmCreate("BossCard8_et", 0.0f, 0.0f, 100, 0, 0);
    circlePos(%F0, %F1, %ANGLE, 1400.0f);
    enmCreate("BossCard8_et", 0.0f, 0.0f, 100, 0, 0);
    circlePos(%F0, %F1, %ANGLE - 0.5235988f, 1400.0f);
    enmCreate("BossCard8_et", 0.0f, 0.0f, 100, 0, 0);
    circlePos(%F0, %F1, %ANGLE - 1.0471976f, 1400.0f);
    enmCreate("BossCard8_et", 0.0f, 0.0f, 100, 0, 0);
    return;
}[/code]

The float variable ``ANGLE`` is given the value ``[ins=1, n=-9989] - 3.1415927f``, where [ins=1, n=-9989] is the angle between the parent object (in this case Momoyo) and the player.
[ins=1, n=-9989] is calculated as follows: ``[ins=1, n=-9989] = arctan2([ins=1, n=-9962] - [ins=1, n=-9990], [ins=1, n=-9963] - [ins=1, n=-9991])``

The instruction ``[ins=0, n=81](float varX, float varY, float ang, float radius)`` performs the following two actions: ``varX = cos(ang) * radius`` and ``varY = sin(ang) * radius``
The instruction ``[ins=0, n=81](%[ins=1, n=-9981], %[ins=1, n=-9980], %ANGLE + 1.0471976f, 1400.0f)`` performs the following two actions: ``[ins=1, n=-9981] = cos(ANGLE + 1.0471976f) * 1400.0`` and ``[ins=1, n=-9981] = sin(ANGLE + 1.0471976f) * 1400.0``

The instruction [ins=0, n=300] is quite complicated, so it will be summarised in this page. To put it simply, ``[ins=0, n=300]("BossCard8_et", 0.0f, 0.0f, 100, 0, 0);`` creates an enemy ``BossCard8_et`` at Momoyo's position.

The ``return`` keyword tells Momoyo to go back to the subroutine ``BossCard8`` where she will keep looping her attacking.

#### BossCard8_et
[hr_minor]

For convenience, the code is posted below again:

[code]void BossCard8_et() {
    var DECREMENT;
    [...]
    $DECREMENT = $I1;
BossCard8_et_1040:
    [...]
    etOn(1);
    wait(3);
BossCard8_et_1284:
    if ($DECREMENT--) goto BossCard8_et_1040 @ 0;
    delete();
}
[/code]

[hl2]The integer variable ``DECREMENT`` is declared and is assigned the value [ins=1, n=-9984], which was declared in the subroutine ``BossCard8``[/hl2].
Instruction ``[ins=0, n=601](int id)`` makes the bullets spawn. In this case, ``[ins=0, n=601](1)`` spawns the arrowhead bullets.
Instruction ``[ins=0, n=23](int time);`` stops the subroutine execution for ``time`` frames, so ``[ins=0, n=23](3)`` stops the execution time for 3 frames.
Instruction ``[ins=0, n=1]();`` deletes the caller once called. In this case, the subroutine ``BossCard8_et`` destroys itself once called.
Although it is written quite obtusely, the end part of subroutine ``BossCard8_et`` keeps shooting bullets through instruction ``[ins=0, n=601](1)`` until the integer variable ``DECREMENT`` is exactly equal to 0. The variable ``DECREMENT`` decreases by 1 every iteration.

### Cause of Bullet spam
[hr_minor]

Instruction ``[ins=0, n=91](0, %F1, 3600, 0, 3.0f, 30.0f)`` writes to the variable [ins=1, n=-9980] for exactly 3600 frames. However, [hl2]once those 3600 frames have passed, the variable [ins=1, n=-9980] is no longer updated by the instruction [ins=0, n=91][/hl2].
Instead, [hl2]the variable ``F1`` is set by the instruction [ins=0, n=81][/hl2], where ``[ins=1, n=-9980] = sin(A - 1.0471976f) * 1400.0 = sin([ins=1, n=-9989] - 4.1887903f) * 1400.0``. This means that [hl2]the amount of bullets spawning depends on the [ins=1, n=-9989] value.[/hl2] Following this, the value [ins=1, n=-9984] is equal to [ins=1, n=-9980] but [ins=1, n=-9984] is an integer. The variable ``DECREMENT`` is equal to the value of [ins=1, n=-9984].

The invisible enemy bullet spawner ``BossCard8_et`` only despawns if ``DECREMENT`` is equal to 0. This means that the value ``DECREMENT`` must be low enough where the variable ``DECREMENT`` is in the range ``[0, 30]`` such that it doesn't go on infinitely (30 is chosen here because that is its intended maximum value that ZUN set according to [ins=0, n=91]). For ``DECREMENT`` to be low enough, the value [ins=1, n=-9984] must be low enough. For [ins=1, n=-9984] to be low enough, the value of [ins=1, n=-9980] must be low enough. For [ins=1, n=-9980] to be low enough, ``sin([ins=1, n=-9989] -1.0471977f) * 1400.0`` must be low enough.

To give an estimate how precisely-small [ins=1, n=-9989] for there to be no bullet spam, the angles will be calculated for when there are a total of 0 and 30 lingering bullets.
For there to be exactly 0 lingering bullets, the variable [ins=1, n=-9989] must be around [hl2]1.0471977[/hl2].
For there to be exactly 30 lingering bullets, the variable [ins=1, n=-9989] must be around [hl2]1.0686279[/hl2].

If the variable [ins=1, n=-9989] were any higher, then the integer variable ``DECREMENT`` is a [hl2]much higher value[/hl2]. This means that the invisible enemy bullet spawner would have to [hl2]shoot a few thousand bullets[/hl2] before it despawns. Furthermore, if the variable [ins=1, n=-9989] [hl2]were any lower[/hl2], then the integer variable ``DECREMENT`` is a negative value. It means that the value would have to underflow, meaning it has to [hl2]go through a few billion iterations[/hl2] before the invisible enemy bullet spawner despawns.

To visualise how precise the angles are, [hl2]I have modified the stage such that Momoyo shoots lasers that are at the aforementioned angles[/hl2]. Anything outside the lasers gives the player waves that are going to last a while:

[img=bugs/th18/7_angle.png, figtitle=Visualisation of the precise angle is shown in pink., alt=Two lines spawn out of Momoyo pointing to the bottom right.] [br]

In order to humanely timeout this spell, the player must be between the two lasers when Momoyo is spawning the invisible bullet spawning enemies. [hl2]This is humanely impossible to do[/hl2] considering Momoyo constantly moves around alongside the difficulty of the spell.

### Conclusion
[hr_minor]

[box=1000] The bullets on Dragon Eater [hl2]are shot a small number of times[/hl2] before it stops shooting. However, after 60 seconds there is an [hl2]overwhelming number of bullets[/hl2] each wave. This is because part of the [hl2]code is accessed differently[/hl2]. Instead, the amount of bullets that are shot depends on your [hl2]player angle[/hl2]. [/box]
