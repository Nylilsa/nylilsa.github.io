## [what]
[hr_minor]

It is possible to cause a game crash by using the Lily White card.
...though, its method is quite a wack one.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

The game can be crashed by dying right before a shop menu spawns. This can only be done with the Lily White card as she allows for the player to die post-dialogue.

## [why_idk]
[hr_minor]

Most likely, the game expects the player to be in an alive state during the shop. Though, by dying the player state is different, causing the game to freak out.
