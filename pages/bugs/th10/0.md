## [what]
[hr_minor]

MarisaB deals a ton of damage, allowing her to capture patterns with ease. This bug can happen at any time during the game, meaning you can do a MarisaB LNN with this glitch.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

This bug can take place during any point in the game. The requirement is to have a [hl2]power in the range 3.00-3.95[/hl2] and [hl2]shoot unfocused[/hl2]. Contrary to popular belief, the part of Marisa that deals a lot of damage are her [hl2]right missiles[/hl2], and the damage does not come from the lasers.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

The data of MarisaB's shot is stored in the file ``pl01b.sht``. In the file, most data about the shottype can be found. The damage values of MarisaB's lasers go as follows:

|   No-Focus  | Laser 1 | Laser 2 | Laser 3 | Laser 4 |
|:-----------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 0.00 - 0.95 |         |         |         |         |
| 1.00 - 1.95 |    10   |         |         |         |
| 2.00 - 2.95 |    10   |    10   |         |         |
| 3.00 - 3.95 |    9    |    10   |    9    |         |
| 4.00 - 5.00 |    9    |    10   |    10   |    9    |

|    Focus    | Laser 1 | Laser 2 | Laser 3 | Laser 4 |
|:-----------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 0.00 - 0.95 |         |         |         |         |
| 1.00 - 1.95 |    10   |         |         |         |
| 2.00 - 2.95 |    10   |    10   |         |         |
| 3.00 - 3.95 |    9    |    10   |    9    |         |
| 4.00 - 5.00 |    9    |    10   |    10   |    9    |

[hl2]It can be seen that there is nothing off with the damage values of MarisaB's lasers[/hl2].

The damage values of MarisaB's missiles go as follows:

|   No-Focus  | Missile Left | Missile Right |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:-------------:|             
| 0.00 - 0.95 |      15      |      15       |           
| 1.00 - 1.95 |      14      |      14       |           
| 2.00 - 2.95 |      13      |      13       |             
| 3.00 - 3.95 |      12      |[hl1]122[/hl1] |            
| 4.00 - 5.00 |      11      |      11       |             

[br]

|     Focus     | Missile Left | Missile Right|
|:-------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|  0.00 - 0.95  |      15      |      15      |
|  1.00 - 1.95  |      14      |      14      |
|  2.00 - 2.95  |      13      |      13      |
|  3.00 - 3.95  |      12      |      12      |
|  4.00 - 5.00  |      11      |      11      |

[hl2]The damage output from MarisaB's right missile when unfocused at a power between 3.00-3.95 is 122 per missile[/hl2] instead of 12 per missile. This means the missile deals [hl2]916.67% more damage[/hl2] than its intended value. This is because ZUN typed an extra "2", resulting in the missile's damage being ``122`` instead of ``12``.
