## [what]
[hr_minor]

Using a bomb sometimes causes enemies to despawn. This only applies to enemies coming from the right side of the screen.

<!-- (insert screenshot of stage 6 right before midboss, only one enemy showing up from side) -->

## [how]
[hr_minor]

Use a bomb right as an enemy is about to appear from off-screen. This more notably happens when the screen-shaking effect is extremely violent, which is with the shottypes ReimuB and MarisaA.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

To know why this happens, we must first understand what makes an enemy despawn, and what bombing does to the screen.

### Despawning conditions
[hr_minor]

For an enemy to despawn by leaving the screen, exactly two conditions must be fulfilled:
1. The enemy must have been in bounds at least once before: [ins=2, n=7] must be true,
2. The enemy must currently be out of bounds.

(The purpose of the first point is to prevent the enemy from immediately despawning if the enemy spawns from off-screen)

To check whether the enemy has been in bounds or not, the following function is used:

[code]boolean is_in_bounds(x, y, enemy_width, enemy_height):
    if (x + enemy_width / 2) < 0:
        return false
    if (x - enemy_width / 2) > screen_width:
        return false
    if (y + enemy_height / 2) < 0:
        return false
    if (y - enemy_height / 2) > screen_height:
        return false
    return true
[/code]

Below is an example on how the enemy despawning process works:

The second panel shows the enemy entering the screen ([ins=2, n=7] = true, [ins=2, n=8] = true). The third panel shows the enemy exiting the screen and despawning ([ins=2, n=7] = true, [ins=2, n=8] = false), alt=Three screenshots of the an enemy spawning, being on-screen and despawning]

### Screenshaking effect
[hr_minor]

The screenshake effect is an effect that modifies the position of the screen as well as the size of the screen. The logic for screenshaking goes as follows:
+ Pick a random number between 0 and 2.
+ Depending on the random number:
    + The screen's [hl2]position moves[/hl2] slightly
    + The screen's [hl2]dimensions decrease[/hl2] slightly
+ This logic is applied independently to both the X and Y axes. 

The second point "The screen's dimensions decrease slightly" is the only part of interest. Below is shown pseudocode of the relevant part of the screenshake effect.

[code]if (random_integer(0, 2) == 0) {
    screen_width = 384.0
} else {
    screen_width = 384.0 - screen_offset
}

if (random_integer(0, 2) == 0) {
    screen_height = 448.0
} else {
    screen_height = 448.0 - screen_offset
}
[/code]

``screen_offset`` is calculated as follows:

[code]screen_offset(timer) = ((end_offset - start_offset) / effect_length) * timer + start_offset[/code]

This follows the linear equation ``y = mx + b`` with parameters:
+ ``y`` being the output (``screen_offset``)
+ ``m`` being the slope: (``end_offset`` - ``start_offset``) / ``effect_length``
+ ``x`` being the independent variable (``timer``) starting from 0
+ ``b`` being the y-intercept: ``start_offset``

The values of ``effect_length``, ``start_offset``, and ``end_offset`` are hardcoded values that are specific to each character. Below is a table summarising the values for every case.

| Shottype | Bomb Trigger condition | effect_length | start_offset | end_offset |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| ReimuA   | On orb explosion       | 16            | 8            | 0          |
| ReimuB   | First 60 frames        | 60            | 2            | 6          |
|          | After first 60 frames  | 80            | 20           | 0          |
| MarisaA  | First 120 frames       | 120           | 4            | 1          |
| MarisaB  | Frames 60-120          | 60            | 1            | 7          |
|          | After 120 frames       | 200           | 24           | 0          |

It follows that the maximum value of ``screen_offset`` is equal to ``max(start_offset, end_offset)``, which is ``screen_offset = 24`` with MarisaB as shottype. Below is an image that demonstrates ``screen_offset`` being 24:
