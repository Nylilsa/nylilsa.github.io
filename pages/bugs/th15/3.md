## [what] 
[hr_minor]

When you capture Hecatia's first non-spell, the shooting bonus is always 50%.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

You get this by *killing* Hecatia on her first non-spell as any character.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

Before the chapter is set, there are two enemies on-screen: [hl2]Hecatia and Junko[/hl2]. Both enemies share the same *weight*, meaning that both contribute to the shooting bonus equally. Since Junko isn't killable, it means that you can never get the 50% of what Junko has. Because of this, you can only target Hecatia and get 50% shooting bonus on Hecatia's first non-spell.

Any Extra run that reaches Hecatia on the first non-spell is valid, so none are provided.
