## [what]
[hr_minor]

It is possible to consistently [hl2]skip multiple stages in the Story mode[/hl2] of the game. In both versions, you can skip until the final stage. Performing [hl2]the stage skip on the final stage crashes the game[/hl2]. Performing the stage skip on Extra stage warps the player back to Stage 1. 

## [how]
[hr_minor]

The stage skip bug can be performed on both version 1.00 and version 1.50a.

### 1.00 skip

To perform the skip on version 1.00, the player must do the following:
1. Enter Story mode on any difficulty as any character;
2. Reset by pressing the [key=R] key.

### 1.50a skip

To perform the skip on version 1.00, the player must do the following:
1. Enter Story mode on any difficulty as any character;
2. Select the option ``Return to Title``;
3. Hover your cursor over ``Yes``;
4. Simultaneously press the keys [key=Z] and [key=Up], or [key=Z] and [key=Down].

## [why]

### 1.00 skip

WIP

### 1.50a skip

<!-- https://xcancel.com/CyrusWVorazan/status/1521008122457989120 -->

There is a state variable that keeps track of the states of menus. Depending on its value, it does different things. (for technical readers, the state variable in version 1.50a is th09.exe+D66F8)

When hovering over ``Yes``, the state variable is set to ``4``. When hovering over ``No``, the state variable is set to ``5``. When pressing ``Yes``, the state variable updates to ``(state != 4) + 8``. This effectively updates ``state`` to ``8``. However, by immediately switching to ``No`` by pressing Up/Down after pressing ``Yes``, the ``state`` gets set to ``5`` (because it hovers over ``No``). Then, the ``state = (state != 4) + 8`` runs, effectively setting the new ``state`` to ``9``. This state variable ``9`` happens to progress to the next stage.
