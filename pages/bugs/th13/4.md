## [what]
[hr_minor]

This desync only happens when [hl2]starting a replay directly from Stage 2, Stage 3 or Stage 4[/hl2], in which case the player dies to the first few enemies that spawn. The replay would otherwise work normally when started on any other stage, assuming no other desync takes place. This desync does not apply to Practice Mode replays.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

For this desync, the [hl2]player must die[/hl2] by any of the first few enemies that spawn in Stage 2, Stage 3 or Stage 4. It is not possible on Stage 5 and Stage 6 because the enemies take too long to spawn.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

When starting a replay from any stage, the player character is given 120 frames of invincibility. When ramming into an enemy normally, the player dies the moment contact is made with the fairy. However, when ramming into an enemy starting the replay from Stage 2, Stage 3 or Stage 4, the player can either [hl2]go through the fairy and survive[/hl2], or [hl2]still die to the fairy but a few frames later[/hl2]. Regardless, both options result in a different outcome than what the original, causing the desync.
