## [what]
[hr_minor]

Replays using Marisa have a high chance of desyncing when the replay is started directly from a stage between Stage 2 and Stage 6. More notably, the desync often happens after a (mid-)boss encounter. This desync also only happens in replays where Marisa's missiles are used, meaning replays that only shoot with Marisa's unfocus shot do not desync.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

1. Obtain a Main game Marisa replay that makes it to at least Stage 2. Make sure this replay uses Marisa's focused shot.
2. Select the replay and select a stage between Stage 2 and Stage 6 inclusive
3. Watch the replay
 
There is a high chance the replay will desync at any given point in which Marisa dies at unexpected places. However, it is also likely that the replay does not desync. In the latter case, you might notice that the score at the end of the stage does not match the score in the replay, only differing by a few points.
