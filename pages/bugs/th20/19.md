## [what]
[hr_minor]


The replay menu screen shows the wrong stage on some stages.

Stage 1 Game Over: St1
Stage 2 Game Over: St2
Stage 3 Game Over: St3
Stage 4 Game Over: All
Stage 5 Game Over: St4
Stage 6 Game Over: St5
Main game Run Clear: Ex
Extra Game Over: St6
Extra Clear: Ex

The corrected version would be as follows:

Stage 1 Game Over: St1
Stage 2 Game Over: St2
Stage 3 Game Over: St3
Stage 4 Game Over: St4
Stage 5 Game Over: St5
Stage 6 Game Over: St6
Main game Run Clear: All
Extra Game Over: Ex
Extra Clear: All

## [how]
[hr_minor]

This happens by default when going into the Replay menu.

## [why_idk]
[hr_minor]

This is probably because ZUN forgot to rearrange the strings after the demo.
