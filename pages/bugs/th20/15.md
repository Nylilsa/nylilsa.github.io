## [what]
[hr_minor]

Yellow-1 options are positioned a certain distance above Reimu/Marisa, and deal contact damage on enemies. This damage persist during the stage transition. This bug has a weird effect mid-game where the lingering options can deal a massive amount of damage to any enemies in later stages.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

To replicate: Unhold Shift and Z at the same time. It is quite hard to replicate. This effect disappears once you shoot. You need to time it so you unhold shift when your short timer is 14. Make sure that exactly one of your shooter stones are Y1: they cannot be both Y1.
