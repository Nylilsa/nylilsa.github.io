## [what]
[hr_minor]

Sometimes, the player can fail to spawn a stone despite meeting the gauge requirement. The pyramid will fail to formerly spawn and not drop anything or reduce gauge.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

This behaviour seems to happen when the player spawns a stone right as an attack ends. This seems to be frame-perfect

## [why_idk]
[hr_minor]

This might be because the attack ending calls for an ECL instruction killing everything on-screen. This might interfere with the stone spawning. More research is needed.
