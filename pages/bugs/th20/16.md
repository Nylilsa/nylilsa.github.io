## [what]
[hr_minor]

The player can obtain stones in the Wide stone slot/Narrow stone slot/Passive stone slot despite not owning the stone. This allows players to use stones they either haven't unlocked or haven't obtained enough copies of.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

To replicate: Hover over the stone you want, then close the game. Upon reopening the game, the character will have the previous stone selected.

## [why_idk]
[hr_minor]

When selecting a Wonder Stone for an equippable slot in the Stone Select menu, the game will show a preview of the currently selected stone. This selection appears to immedately write to the player's savefile regardless of whether or not they can equip the stone, allowing them to close the game and keep the stone equipped in that slot.
