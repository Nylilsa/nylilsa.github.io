## [what]
[hr_minor]

The screen can get covered with persisting stone menus.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

In (Spell) Practice mode, go to the stones selection menu. Press Z, then quickly exit. If done fast enough, the sprite should persist and not despawn. It is quite precise to perform.

## [why_idk]
[hr_minor]

This is probably done because the player does an action (changing the menu) before the animation can fully finish, making the stone menu persist indefinitely.
