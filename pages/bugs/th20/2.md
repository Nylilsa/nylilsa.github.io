## [how]
[hr_minor]

In FW, Nina can only gain a hurtbox on her survival spell-card only if [hl2]the player's bomb ends during the survival spell-card[/hl2]. For example, a bomb can be used before the survival spell-card and end during the survival spell-card, or a bomb can be used during the survival spell-card and end during the survival spell-card.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

The code of Nina's boss-fight is located in a file called ``st07bs.ecl``. During the survival spell-card, Nina is given the [ins=0, n=546] instruction. This instruction is also given on all her other spell-cards.

The [ins=0, n=546] instruction makes the parent (in this case, Nina) [hl2]invincible when a bomb is triggered[/hl2]. Once the bomb has ended, the parent [hl2]regains its hurtbox[/hl2].

Since Nina is given a [ins=0, n=546] instruction on her survival spell-card, it means [hl2]she regains a hurtbox once the bomb has ended[/hl2]. This is exactly what happens and this is what causes Nina to gain a hurtbox during her survival spell-card.
