## [what]
[hr_minor]

Bullets have a chance to fail to spawn, or sometimes bullets can be rotated weirdly or have the wrong sprite. This behaviour will not be recorded into any replays.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

This behaviour happens at random and is out of control for any player.

## [why_idk]
[hr_minor]

Bullets using a common bullet transformation have a chance to not spawn because the bullet transformation includes an uninitialized variable. Depending on the value there is a chance bullets may not spawn or for bullets to have a weird sprite.
