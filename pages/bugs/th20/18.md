## [how]
[hr_minor]

Exactly one frame before a menu appears (e.g. the "Game Over" text), press Esc + R.

## [why_idk]
[hr_minor]

When doing Esc + R, the game progresses by a few frames before the stage restarts. By doing Esc + R before it resets, the "fading" effect of pausing is applied while the game resets. The result is the overlaid effect of pausing while also being able to continue playing.
