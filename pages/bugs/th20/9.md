## [what]
[hr_minor]

Bombs have the ability to persist through stage transition. The bombs will keep their hurtbox and sprite. Starting a replay from a stage after this bug has been performed will desync the replay.

## [how]
[hr_minor]

This bug happens if the player bombs right before the stage transition happens.

## [why_idk]
[hr_minor]

The game does not delete the bomb object during the stage transition, allowing it to persist to the next stage(s).
