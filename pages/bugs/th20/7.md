## [what]
[hr_minor]

A replay can desync on Nina's 4th spell-card. 

## [how]
[hr_minor]

The desync happens if the player views the replay from a different resolution than what was used.

## [why]
[hr_minor]

The Nina resolution desync happens because the enemies that spawn the bullets on Nina's 4th spell-card use the polygon draw mode. This draw mode doesn't set one of the dimensions of the sprite size, which makes it use the sprite size of some random dummy sprite in the ASCII ANMs. The dummy sprite size differs per resolution. Since they differ per resolution, the enemy will have a different size in the game, which can cause some enemies to despawn whereas if they had a smaller/bigger dimension the despawning would be different.
