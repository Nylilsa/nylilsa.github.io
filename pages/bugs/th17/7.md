## [how]
[hr_minor]

In WBaWC, Saki can only gain a hurtbox on the survival spell-card through one way: [hl2]the player's bomb must end during the survival spell-card[/hl2].


## [why]
[hr_minor]

The code of Saki's boss-fight is located in a file called ``st07bs.ecl``. During the survival spell-card, Saki is given the [ins=0, n=546] instruction. This instruction is also given during all her other spell-cards.

The [ins=0, n=546] instruction makes the parent object (in this case, Saki) invincible when a bomb is triggered. Once the bomb has ended, the parent object regains its hurtbox.

Since Saki is given a [ins=0, n=546] instruction on her survival spell-card, it means she regains a hurtbox once the bomb has ended. This is exactly what happens and this is what causes Saki to gain a hurtbox during her survival spell-card.
