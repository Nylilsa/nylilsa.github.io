## Introduction
[hr_minor]

We all know ReimuA DDC is goated. I mean, just _look_ at her. She has a massive Gohei that deals above average damage compared to the other shottypes.

But wait, the gohei isn't at its full potential - currently a part of it is hitting the boss. This is because the Gohei gets recoiled by the hitbox it is currently hitting. However, we can prevent this by [hl2]centering[/hl2] the gohei !

[img=me/gohei_center.png, figtitle=TOBEADDED, alt=TOBEADDED] [br]

Now that gohei is used to its fullest potential, but our damage certainly isn't. We can also summon homing amulets by [hl2]shiftspamming[/hl2] quickly unshifting and shifting while keeping the gohei alive !

...alright, surely that must the maximum damage we can deal, right? We're getting the most out of our single gohei through [hl2]centering[/hl2], and at the same time we're shooting the amulets by [hl2]shiftspamming[/hl2]. There's nothing else we can do to achieve more damage it seems as we've quite literally run out of fire power.

...well, not quite.

There exists a [a=/#/bugs/th14/4]glitch[/a] that allows for multiple goheis to be created. The glitch can create up to 4 goheis at once, and all of the goheis act the same way. The name of the glitch is also known as [hl2]Gohei duplication[/hl2] or [hl2]Gohei dupe[/hl2] or [hl2]dupe[/hl2] in short.

## Gohei duplication glitch
[hr_minor]

This is an incredibly hard glitch to execute as there are a bunch of factors involved:

1. The player's y-coordinate
2. The distance between the gohei and a target
3. Your button mashing capabilities
4. Luck

Note that you don't need any enemies to be on-screen to perform the dupe glitch.

### Y-coordinate
[hr_minor]

The gohei dupe can only be done [hl2]at specific heights[/hl2]. Below is an image that should roughly give you an indicator where to be if you want to do the dupe.

[img=me/range.png, figtitle=TOBEADDED, alt=TOBEADDED] [br]

Since it's at quite a height it means you need to go to the top if you want to do the dupe glitch. If you want to do the dupe on bosses, it means you have to go to the top left or top right for it to work.

### Gohei-target distance
[hr_minor]

The gohei has a feature that, when shot, instantly centers on a target. You can see this if you are up-close to an enemy. This is good if you want to dump a gohei on an enemy real quick, but this makes it [hl2]impossible[/hl2] to do the gohei dupe glitch.

Instead, you want to have a great enough distance such that the gohei doesn't instantly goes towards the target.

### Button spamming
[hr_minor]

[img=me/cps.png, figtitle=TOBEADDED, alt=TOBEADDED] [br]

The general rule is that the faster you can mash your buttons the better it is. This section isn't very much about talking about the techniques of button mashing (though I might add a section about this later). I personally use one keyboard for all my inputs. With it, I average about 12 clicks per second on my [key=Shift] key, though it is possible to get multiple goheis even when your clicks per second is 6. If you want to check out what your clicks per second is, you can check it out on [a=https://cps-check.com/keyboard-cps]this website[/a].

Some people might prefer other input devices, such as the use of a controller, a separate keyboard for your other hand or a Guitar Hero. I don't know how those devices work, but I am sure the same concept applies where you need a high CPS.

### Luck
[hr_minor]

Honestly, sometimes it doesn't really make much sense, but luck is involved when doing this glitch. You can do the exact same inputs twice, but in one instance you may only get 1 gohei and in the other you may be lucky to get 3 goheis. There isn't much else I can say, really...

## Video

[video=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Swh3whaeXcQ, hratio=2, other=width:720px; aspect-ratio:16/9]


The video above demonstrates the different ways ReimuA can maximise her damage. The times mentioned below is the same time I got in this video but two seconds are subtracted from it. This was done because Seija starts off with invincibility frames for one second, and her death animation lasts for one second.

Method 1. Focus only + no amulet spam | 20.41s
Method 2. Re-centering + no amulet spam | 16.16s
Method 3. No centering + amulet spam | 15.46s
Method 4. 0/2 centered double gohei + no amulet spam | 14.01s
Method 5. Centering + amulet spam | 13.68s
Method 6. 0/2 centered double gohei + amulet spam | 12.01s
Method 7. 2/2 centered double gohei + amulet spam | 10.63s
Method 8. 0/3 centered triple gohei + amulet spam | 9.10s
Method 9. 3/3 centered triple gohei + amulet spam | 8.25s

There are some things to keep note of though.

Method 2 and method 5 are only possible if the player can go high enough to reach the boss. This is possible on most patterns except those that force the player to be low on-screen.
While method 7 and method 9 are extremely powerful, their additional power comes from the first couple of seconds in which the goheis are centered. After those couple seconds the goheis slowly diverge from the boss and less DPS is dealt to the boss. In this video, the 2/2 centered double gohei is about 12.9% faster than the 0/2 centered double gohei method. If I chose a different attack that has more HP, then the ratio would be less than 12.9% because the 2/2 centered double gohei only deals more damage at the beginning of the attack.

## Sum of Best
[hr_minor]

Anyways, the reason why I wrote this is to keep track of my best Spell-card bonuses, or SCBs for short. I basically wanted to see how far I could reach the upper limit, where the upper limit is equal to the starting SCB value of a spell. I will be comparing the scores to the (previous) WRs as well as my average SCBs.

### Lunatic difficulty
[hr_minor]

For this difficulty I did every spell-card with 4-power ReimuA except the first three spell-cards. Cirno's mid-spell was done using 1 power and Wakasagihime's first and second spell-card were done with 2 power.
