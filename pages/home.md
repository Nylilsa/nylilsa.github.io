Hi everyone, <br><br>

Some people are wondering about my whereabouts, but do not worry about it, it was a temporary hiatus (a [hl2]hibernation[/hl2] if you can call it like that). I've been dealing with some [hl2]personal issues and difficulties[/hl2] that have mostly been resolved now. Regardless, I would like to announce some exciting news ! <br><br>

This site initially started of small, but over the course of a few years it has grown steadily. I have been working a roadmap that will bring this site to the next level: <br> 

1. [hl2]Updated WR History[/hl2] - Mostly on backend to make it more robust, but also partly QoL features on the front-end. <br>
2. More pages - Currently, there are very few pages describing bugs; the idea is to vastly increase this number. <br>
3. Get a [hl2]custom domain[/hl2] - Instead of hosting on GitHub it would be hosted on a custom domain ! <br><br>

(i don't know what to add here yet, i will think about it)

Hello there, I hope you are having a wonderful day today ! On website I want to provide game knowledge and resources to the Touhou community ! This is a solo project of mine, meaning I did all the coding, research, design, more research, doing all the writing, etc., so excuse me if there are any inaccuracies !

## About this Website
[hr_minor]

### World Record Progression

There is a page titled [jumpto=#/wr]World Record Progression[/jumpto]. The page is a [hl2]comprehensive Touhou world records tracker[/hl2], updated every so often. The page includes an interactive graph and a table of your selected game along with [hl2]replay support[/hl2] for most WR entries ! Please feel free to check it out as this is the cumulation of about a year's worth of hard work from replay gathering, replay processing, file management, score gathering, etc. !

### Bugs/Glitch

This website's primary purpose was to be a [hl2]repository for all documented glitches[/hl2] I have been able to find and properly document of Touhou Project. This part is still Work In Progress: if you want to know more about a game's glitches it is best to [jumpto=#/home#contact]contact me personally[/jumpto].

### Guides

Sometimes I or other people will write [hl2]guides[/hl2]. Those guides are posted on this website. If you wish for a Touhou-related guide of yours to be posted on this website, please [jumpto=#/home#contact]contact me[/jumpto] and we can talk about it.
